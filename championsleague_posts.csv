Welcome back to **Friendly Friday**, where we hit pause on the banter and take a moment to appreciate the *best* in our rival clubs.

Whether it’s a legendary player, an incredible atmosphere at their stadium, a well-run youth academy, or just the sheer consistency of their success — today’s the day to give credit where it’s due. 

Have you gained respect for a rival after a hard-fought match? Been impressed by how their fans stuck with them through tough times? Maybe there’s a moment in their history that even you, as a rival fan, can’t help but admire.

**This is your space to share:**

* 💬 Positive stories or experiences involving rival clubs
* 🔍 Things you respect (even begrudgingly!)
* 🙌 Moments of sportsmanship and class
* 🧠 Interesting facts or insights that show another side of a rival

Let’s keep it respectful, light-hearted, and true to the spirit of the game we all love.

**Today, we root for respect. Let the positivity begin!**"

How do we even compare this to other heartbreaking UCL runs?

It's '*Atletico*', not '*Athletico*', as so many seem to use instead. It's not like they're a small club rarely in the limelight either. one of the big 3 in Spain, and probably one of the twenty biggest clubs in Europe, consistently playing in the Champions League.

Just this week I heard two people on a podcast say Athletico. I can handle a casual observer getting it wrong, and even mispronunciations of obscure player names, but people who are football journalists for a living, including ex-players, should be getting this right.

I have no idea if the existence of 'Athletic' Bilbao is partly responsible for confusing them, but I still think professionals in the football world ought to be pronouncing Atleti's name correctly."

They can beat a rather inconsistent Atletico and Barca based on their UCL form. Luck needs to be involved too, ideally, Bodo gonna eliminate Arsenal because I don't think tot can do anything against Eze, and, City is their opp in the final.

If the stars align perfectly, tot have a good chance to become the newest UCL champ.

1rfui4j,The misconception of Bodo/Glimt,Deathnotefan76,68,134,2026-02-27 07:36:50,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1rfui4j/the_misconception_of_bodoglimt/,"I see alot of these different fans from teams like Man city, Real Madrid, Arsenal etc saying they'd prefer to get either Bodo or sporting, I understand why on paper it seems like those are the weakest opponents, but I think theres a massive reason as to why you'd rather not get Bodo, I can't make a strong argument for sporting, they are a tricky team but for Bodo, the temperatures stay at around below 0 during this time of year sometimes going below -10, I think thats also what makes Bodo's starting 11 super interesting, 9 out 11 are Norwegian born and bred  the other 2 main starters  are also from northern countries so they have that adaptation to the cold climate, when teams fly there usually its around 24 hours before a game, the human body can't adapt well to that climate within such a short period of time no matter even if you're a professional athlete at the highest standards, and thats why their team has such an advantage, opponents usually get worn out halfway throughout the game and since their team is literally genetically advanced they just hit them well on counters, not to mention Aspmyra is one of the few stadiums where they use artificial turf simply because grass can't grow there, their team is also well adapted to it while opponents complain everytime they go there. Now I think one of their major advantages is if they get the home game at Bodo first, they're more likely to make a statement at home then just park the bus at the away leg. although I suppose it'd be slightly easier if they played away first."

These guys simply don't care who you put against them; that same year they reached copa italia final against Juve and lost but that's the thing about this team, if they have to lose, they lose but with great football and there's nothing more dangerous than a team who doesn't care about losing. I'm telling you, they're the dark horses here, not Bodo, not Galatasaray.

Dortmund vs Atlanta was an incredible game and we were robbed of extra time. Again the ref trots over to VAR after not giving anything, because it was a good tackle, Atlanta player attacks the ball downward to head it and from any game I have played or watched that is fair game for a boot in to challenge.  Then to produce a second yellow after playing the tackle back on VAR slower and slower, slow motion enhances the magnitude of the challenge.   
  
The refs really imposed themselves more than I thought they would after the first round last week, hopefully the CL can fix it. VAR should really have no ability to talk to the referee they should play him the clip at full speed max 3 times then a decision needs to be made.

I’ve been seeing a lot of static graphics about the UCL “replacement spot” / titleholder spot and who would benefit if the UCL winner also qualifies via their domestic league.

So I built a small web page that tracks it in a live dashboard format:

	•	Current projected recipient (highlighted)

	•	Contenders and who’s out

	•	Domestic league context (position, points, games played)

	•	Gap to 1st / 2nd so you can immediately see how “safe” a club’s title chances are

Link: https://ucl.cvejicm.net

I’d love feedback:

	•	What should the dashboard show to make this easier to understand?

	•	Any UI/UX improvements or data points you think are missing?

If you share it, also totally fine. the whole point is to make this confusing topic easier to follow."

Say what you want, but Viktor Gyökeres is the second best striker in the Premier League right now behind Erling Haaland.

Yes, the Premier League striker pool isn’t what it used to beal and league as a whole isn’t. It’s not the era of Henry, Drogba, Rooney, Aguero etc. The level overall has dropped. Fine. But that doesn’t change the reality of what’s happening right now.

Even under a manager who clearly didn’t want l him or build around him, he’s still on 15 league goals this season.

And that’s without the system being tailored to him. Without consistent service. Half the time he makes runs and certain players just don’t release the ball early. Watch the games — the runs are there.

Now imagine actually playing to his strengths.

Because here’s the thing:

He’s not always the prettiest footballer. He’s not dropping 10/10 link-up masterclasses every week.

But he’s a goalscorer.

Feed him? He scores.

Play direct? He scores.

Give him space to attack the box? He scores.

And let’s not forget, before coming to Arsenal he scored 100 goals in two seasons and won titles. That’s not a fluke. That’s elite output.

He’s also got 4 goals in the Champions League, so it’s not just domestically.

Haaland is obviously the benchmark. The best pure goal machine in the league.

But after him? Who is clearly better right now?

Despite:

• A manager who didn’t fully want him

• Teammates ignoring runs at times

• A system not built around him

Call him limited if you want. But the guy can bang in goals.

Ronaldo was the ballon d'or holder at the time and was expected to be the top dog in this squad because Raul was at the twilight of his career and Casillas despite being very good wasn't really on CR7's level of hype.

Only Kaka could have been competition for Ronaldo's top dog status but he was later riddled with injuries and felt out of form.
Ronaldo never really had to play with any real Madrid player of his caliber,not even Bale was anywhere near Ronaldo's level, performance and career wise.

Mbappe on the hand joined the European title holders from a weaker team,then has to compete in status with multiple guys who have already won the UCL at least once with key performances like Vini, Bellingham,Courtois etc...
Mbappe isn't a clear cut above unlike Ronaldo.

Maybe this also factors into the performances of Real Madrid lately with the ego wars and the search for a clear cut top dog accepted by everyone as the X factor of the team.

Thoughts?"

They lost, and Arsenal took the spot instead. 

It’s one of those rare moments where something off the pitch completely changed the course of a season, &amp; even Champions League history was shaped by a hotel meal gone wrong.

It's crazy how much champions League truly meant and the depths, teams were willing to go to, in order to qualify.

Many Tottenham players suggested it was foul play by Arsenal. The gunners will say it's in the history of the Tottenham ...

If he had one bad game you'd call him garbage and a flop. Kylian is no question the best player in the world and without him your team would be irrelevant. You have no Kroos no modric no ramos no benzema to save you. Just kylian and all you do is criticize him. Its honestly hilarious

Incoming comments about me being clueless. Let me explain. 

Real Madrid had the better era in the 2010s because of more UCLs and the 3-peat, but when you take individual seasons, Barcelona were overall the stronger club. Barca won more trophies and more El Clasicos in that decade. 

I have no doubt in my mind about 1st place to 9th place. The strongest Barcelona was stronger than the strongest Real Madrid. The weakest Barcelona was also stronger than the weakest Real Madrid. 

I'll take my club Liverpool as example from 17/18 to 19/20.  Manchester City won 2 PLs, 1 FA Cup, and 2 League cups. Liverpool won 1PL and 1UCL, and knocked centurions Man City out of the UCL in 17/18 and reached the final. We also had more wins against them than they against us. Stil, we were not stronger than the Man City of those 3 seasons as a whole. "

If Bodø/Glimt beat Inter, they will be the first Norwegian team to win a Champions League knockout round game. Rosenborg reached the Quarter-Finals in 1996/97, but that was when the Quarter-Finals was the first knockout round, and they lost to Juventus. Bodø/Glimt are also the only Norwegian team to have reached the Semi-Finals of the Europa League.

Do you think they'll do it, and how far do you think they'll go this season? If they beat Inter, they will play either Manchester City or Sporting in the Round of 16.    "
1rclgpb,Why do people act like finishing top of the UCL league phase is a trophy?,Right-Captain-6252,0,54,2026-02-23 21:05:55,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1rclgpb/why_do_people_act_like_finishing_top_of_the_ucl/,"I genuinely don’t get why people treat finishing top 8 in the Champions League league phase like it’s some historic achievement.

The sole aim of this competition is winning the trophy. That’s it.

Not having 5 teams in the top 8 by December.

Not winning the “league phase table”

You either lift the trophy in May or you don’t.

As long as you qualify for the knockouts, the job is done. After that, it’s about mentality, big-game experience, and handling pressure over two legs.

Nobody in 10 years is going to say:

“Remember when they topped the league phase? Unreal side.”

They’ll say:

“They won it.”

Or

“They bottled it.”

And every season we see this hype when multiple Premier League clubs sit high in the early rankings — like that’s some kind of dominance trophy. Historically, when it actually matters — quarter-finals, semi-finals, finals — you consistently see Spanish clubs and other European teams showing up.

When the pressure rises, the list usually gets shorter.

Knockout football is a different sport entirely. Form in autumn doesn’t guarantee anything in spring.

The obsession with league phase rankings just feels like people trying to claim superiority before the real competition even starts.

If you qualify, you’re alive.

If you win it, you’re remembered.

Everything else is noise.
