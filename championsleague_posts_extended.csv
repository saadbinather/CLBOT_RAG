Welcome back to **Friendly Friday**, where we hit pause on the banter and take a moment to appreciate the *best* in our rival clubs.

Whether it’s a legendary player, an incredible atmosphere at their stadium, a well-run youth academy, or just the sheer consistency of their success — today’s the day to give credit where it’s due. 

Have you gained respect for a rival after a hard-fought match? Been impressed by how their fans stuck with them through tough times? Maybe there’s a moment in their history that even you, as a rival fan, can’t help but admire.

**This is your space to share:**

* 💬 Positive stories or experiences involving rival clubs
* 🔍 Things you respect (even begrudgingly!)
* 🙌 Moments of sportsmanship and class
* 🧠 Interesting facts or insights that show another side of a rival

Let’s keep it respectful, light-hearted, and true to the spirit of the game we all love.

**Today, we root for respect. Let the positivity begin!**"

And that was just part of a season full of near misses: 2nd in the Bundesliga, lost the DFB-Pokal, and Ballack missed the World Cup final shortly after. 

How do we even compare this to other heartbreaking UCL runs?

It's '*Atletico*', not '*Athletico*', as so many seem to use instead. It's not like they're a small club rarely in the limelight either. one of the big 3 in Spain, and probably one of the twenty biggest clubs in Europe, consistently playing in the Champions League.

Just this week I heard two people on a podcast say Athletico. I can handle a casual observer getting it wrong, and even mispronunciations of obscure player names, but people who are football journalists for a living, including ex-players, should be getting this right.

I have no idea if the existence of 'Athletic' Bilbao is partly responsible for confusing them, but I still think professionals in the football world ought to be pronouncing Atleti's name correctly."

They can beat a rather inconsistent Atletico and Barca based on their UCL form. Luck needs to be involved too, ideally, Bodo gonna eliminate Arsenal because I don't think tot can do anything against Eze, and, City is their opp in the final.

If the stars align perfectly, tot have a good chance to become the newest UCL champ.

1rfui4j,The misconception of Bodo/Glimt,Deathnotefan76,70,134,2026-02-27 07:36:50,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1rfui4j/the_misconception_of_bodoglimt/,"I see alot of these different fans from teams like Man city, Real Madrid, Arsenal etc saying they'd prefer to get either Bodo or sporting, I understand why on paper it seems like those are the weakest opponents, but I think theres a massive reason as to why you'd rather not get Bodo, I can't make a strong argument for sporting, they are a tricky team but for Bodo, the temperatures stay at around below 0 during this time of year sometimes going below -10, I think thats also what makes Bodo's starting 11 super interesting, 9 out 11 are Norwegian born and bred  the other 2 main starters  are also from northern countries so they have that adaptation to the cold climate, when teams fly there usually its around 24 hours before a game, the human body can't adapt well to that climate within such a short period of time no matter even if you're a professional athlete at the highest standards, and thats why their team has such an advantage, opponents usually get worn out halfway throughout the game and since their team is literally genetically advanced they just hit them well on counters, not to mention Aspmyra is one of the few stadiums where they use artificial turf simply because grass can't grow there, their team is also well adapted to it while opponents complain everytime they go there. Now I think one of their major advantages is if they get the home game at Bodo first, they're more likely to make a statement at home then just park the bus at the away leg. although I suppose it'd be slightly easier if they played away first."

These guys simply don't care who you put against them; that same year they reached copa italia final against Juve and lost but that's the thing about this team, if they have to lose, they lose but with great football and there's nothing more dangerous than a team who doesn't care about losing. I'm telling you, they're the dark horses here, not Bodo, not Galatasaray.

Dortmund vs Atlanta was an incredible game and we were robbed of extra time. Again the ref trots over to VAR after not giving anything, because it was a good tackle, Atlanta player attacks the ball downward to head it and from any game I have played or watched that is fair game for a boot in to challenge.  Then to produce a second yellow after playing the tackle back on VAR slower and slower, slow motion enhances the magnitude of the challenge.   
  
The refs really imposed themselves more than I thought they would after the first round last week, hopefully the CL can fix it. VAR should really have no ability to talk to the referee they should play him the clip at full speed max 3 times then a decision needs to be made.

I’ve been seeing a lot of static graphics about the UCL “replacement spot” / titleholder spot and who would benefit if the UCL winner also qualifies via their domestic league.

So I built a small web page that tracks it in a live dashboard format:

	•	Current projected recipient (highlighted)

	•	Contenders and who’s out

	•	Domestic league context (position, points, games played)

	•	Gap to 1st / 2nd so you can immediately see how “safe” a club’s title chances are

Link: https://ucl.cvejicm.net

I’d love feedback:

	•	What should the dashboard show to make this easier to understand?

	•	Any UI/UX improvements or data points you think are missing?

If you share it, also totally fine. the whole point is to make this confusing topic easier to follow."

Say what you want, but Viktor Gyökeres is the second best striker in the Premier League right now behind Erling Haaland.

Yes, the Premier League striker pool isn’t what it used to beal and league as a whole isn’t. It’s not the era of Henry, Drogba, Rooney, Aguero etc. The level overall has dropped. Fine. But that doesn’t change the reality of what’s happening right now.

Even under a manager who clearly didn’t want l him or build around him, he’s still on 15 league goals this season.

And that’s without the system being tailored to him. Without consistent service. Half the time he makes runs and certain players just don’t release the ball early. Watch the games — the runs are there.

Now imagine actually playing to his strengths.

Because here’s the thing:

He’s not always the prettiest footballer. He’s not dropping 10/10 link-up masterclasses every week.

But he’s a goalscorer.

Feed him? He scores.

Play direct? He scores.

Give him space to attack the box? He scores.

And let’s not forget, before coming to Arsenal he scored 100 goals in two seasons and won titles. That’s not a fluke. That’s elite output.

He’s also got 4 goals in the Champions League, so it’s not just domestically.

Haaland is obviously the benchmark. The best pure goal machine in the league.

But after him? Who is clearly better right now?

Despite:

• A manager who didn’t fully want him

• Teammates ignoring runs at times

• A system not built around him

Call him limited if you want. But the guy can bang in goals.

Ronaldo was the ballon d'or holder at the time and was expected to be the top dog in this squad because Raul was at the twilight of his career and Casillas despite being very good wasn't really on CR7's level of hype.

Only Kaka could have been competition for Ronaldo's top dog status but he was later riddled with injuries and felt out of form.
Ronaldo never really had to play with any real Madrid player of his caliber,not even Bale was anywhere near Ronaldo's level, performance and career wise.

Mbappe on the hand joined the European title holders from a weaker team,then has to compete in status with multiple guys who have already won the UCL at least once with key performances like Vini, Bellingham,Courtois etc...
Mbappe isn't a clear cut above unlike Ronaldo.

Maybe this also factors into the performances of Real Madrid lately with the ego wars and the search for a clear cut top dog accepted by everyone as the X factor of the team.

Incoming comments about me being clueless. Let me explain. 

Real Madrid had the better era in the 2010s because of more UCLs and the 3-peat, but when you take individual seasons, Barcelona were overall the stronger club. Barca won more trophies and more El Clasicos in that decade. 

I have no doubt in my mind about 1st place to 9th place. The strongest Barcelona was stronger than the strongest Real Madrid. The weakest Barcelona was also stronger than the weakest Real Madrid. 

I'll take my club Liverpool as example from 17/18 to 19/20.  Manchester City won 2 PLs, 1 FA Cup, and 2 League cups. Liverpool won 1PL and 1UCL, and knocked centurions Man City out of the UCL in 17/18 and reached the final. We also had more wins against them than they against us. Stil, we were not stronger than the Man City of those 3 seasons as a whole. "

The sole aim of this competition is winning the trophy. That’s it.

Not having 5 teams in the top 8 by December.

Not winning the “league phase table”

You either lift the trophy in May or you don’t.

As long as you qualify for the knockouts, the job is done. After that, it’s about mentality, big-game experience, and handling pressure over two legs.

Nobody in 10 years is going to say:

“Remember when they topped the league phase? Unreal side.”

They’ll say:

“They won it.”

Or

“They bottled it.”

And every season we see this hype when multiple Premier League clubs sit high in the early rankings — like that’s some kind of dominance trophy. Historically, when it actually matters — quarter-finals, semi-finals, finals — you consistently see Spanish clubs and other European teams showing up.

When the pressure rises, the list usually gets shorter.

Knockout football is a different sport entirely. Form in autumn doesn’t guarantee anything in spring.

The obsession with league phase rankings just feels like people trying to claim superiority before the real competition even starts.

If you qualify, you’re alive.

If you win it, you’re remembered.

Everything else is noise.

Liverpool players then wore shirts with his image during warm-ups. This decision shocked fans and sparked widespread criticism. At the time, social media was smaller and outrage more contained, but it still left a lasting mark on the club’s reputation.

Fast forward to 2026: Benfica is defending Gianluca Prestianni after UEFA’s anti-racism protocol was triggered in their Champions League match against Real Madrid. The club posted on social media emphasizing support for their player and casting doubt on the reports from Vinícius Jr.

What stands out is the tension clubs face between **internal cohesion** and **external pressure**. On one hand, they want to protect their players, preserve locker room trust, and maintain authority internally. On the other, public perception, social media scrutiny, and the risk of reputational or commercial damage are enormous  far larger than in 2011.

Both incidents show how clubs try to balance loyalty with accountability, often under the microscope of global audiences. It raises the question: are clubs prioritizing the right thing, or are short-term optics and internal politics still overshadowing moral responsibility?

You have people saying “he provoked so he asked for it” even some saying “if anyone deserves racism it’s vini” and others saying “ he’s crying and lying and being a drama queen”. The one that was even the most disgraceful was how mourinho literally deflected the topic of prestianni and then making it a topic of how vini was provoking with his celebration? Almost like his celebration is a justification for ANOTHER PLAYER to be racist? As if vini is the first one to dance after scoring a goal? (Mourinho out of all people talking about provoking is hilarious) like it’s genuinely just shameless. Yes we concretely don’t know whether the benfica player said something racist or not but let’s be fr and not be clueless we know 90% exactly was said, I mean me personally I don’t even see a reason why Vinicius will lie about something like this when all the other times it happened to him, it wasn’t a lie, as well as both valverde and mbappe confirming what he said. Real Madrid said they sent out evidence to Uefa so we will see how that goes. But genuinely anyone that’s making vini the bad guy or condemning him in this situation should not be acceptable. Even times when he taunts or wtv, if anyones response to that is to attack race then they should be ashamed of themselves as a human being.

And if your response is, “why does this always happen to vini and not his other teammates” it’s because he’s the only one who speaks up on it. The only one who is willing to let lawful action taken against it, and instead of people to be happy that the action helps the beautiful game be equal and no discriminate for all, people are mad that he takes action against it."

He's vital for the team to play as good as possible, and of course his insane goal scoring ability makes him the most complete striker I've ever seen with my eyes (I mean, I don't know if there are others better than him, but I'd rather keep my opinion based on what I actually saw since I started watching football)."

Frankly, they only have a starting XI and that's it. Their bench is almost non-existent. Everything into consideration,  Barca is closer to Brentford level than to Arsenal. No reliable STs, no services from so called greatest RW in the world Yamal, defence is leaking like Oroville Dam. The only world class players who can consistently score and assist they have are Raphinha and Rashford.

How can you be so bad you are giving away the La Liga for one of the worst Real Madrid in recent years?

My solution: Sell Yamal to PSG so you can have the money to buy an actual world class RW in Mbeumo, an actual world class ST like Lautaro and an actual world class defender in Premier League. Also sack the fraud flick and hire Mourinho before Real can do so."

Tonight is a massive Champions League night! To make the matches even more interesting, let’s play a squad-building puzzle.

**The Goal:** Build the highest-rated XI possible using **only** players from tonight's 4 matchups, while hitting every constraint.

# The Matchups (8 Clubs Available)

You may **ONLY** select active players from these specific clubs:

* **Galatasaray vs Juventus**
* **AS Monaco vs PSG**
* **Benfica vs Real Madrid**
* **Dortmund vs Atalanta**

# The Rules &amp; Constraints

**1. Formation**

* **1-4-3-3** (1 GK, 4 Defenders, 3 Midfielders, 3 Attackers).

**2. Roster Constraints**

* **Unique Players:** You can use a specific player only once.
* **The ""One of Each"" Rule:** You must select **at least 1 player** from EACH of the 8 clubs listed above.
   * *Strategy Note:* This will use up 8 of your 11 spots. You have 3 ""wildcard"" spots left to use on any of the 8 clubs.

**3. Ratings Source**

* I will use **EA FC 26 Base Ratings** to determine the team rating

**4. Position Lines**

Players must play in their correct line to earn full points.

* **Attackers:** ST, CF, LW, RW
* **Midfielders:** CAM, CM, CDM, LM, RM
* **Defenders:** CB, LB, RB, LWB, RWB
* **Goalkeeper:** GK

# Scoring System

* **Team Rating:** Sum of all 11 players' Overall Ratings.
* **Invalid Player:** If a player is not from the 8 clubs or doesn't exist = **0 points** for that spot.
* **Out of Position:** If a valid player is in the wrong line (e.g., a CDM placed in Defense) = **-5 point penalty** off their rating.

# How to Submit

Please reply with your lineup and total score calculation in this format:

**Attackers:** \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\]

**Midfielders:** \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\]

**Defenders:** \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\], \[Name/Club/Rating\]

**Goalkeeper:** \[Name/Club/Rating\]  
  
Let me know if something isn’t clear.

Good luck!

However well they're on their way to their #21 title now which is always expected of Inter given it's still the most expensive squad in Italy(in wages at least) and, in paper, the best. So it's just one of those things you cannot really tell if it's the manager or if it's because the squad was greatly inherited by Inzaghi/Conte and just responds properly.

In the UCL they've been pretty inconsistent though. I feel among the things Chivu has brought, there's definitely a verticality and kind of simplicity in build up that wasn't quite there before but he's still pretty divisive within the football media so far. What are your thoughts on his work until now?"

Zinchenko admits he talked back to Pep in training, stopping everything.

He was benched for the next game but learned that Pep teaches rather than punishes. 

Years later Pep called him after winning the treble. 

Guardiola has been misunderstood his whole career for these sort of antics but only a very few survive to tell the tale and earn his respect.

It’s robotic. It’s system football. It’s set-piece routines and long throws like we’re watching rugby half the time. Wingers get to the byline and can’t beat a man. They can’t cross consistently. It’s just pace, run in straight lines, recycle possession, repeat.

And don’t tell me it’s “competitive” because everyone’s close. They’re close because the level isn’t elite. There’s no technical superiority. It’s chaos football. That’s not quality — that’s mediocrity across the board.

The only thing the league is genuinely elite at is PR. Branding. Marketing. Global hype. That’s where it’s number one. The production value is world class. The football? Bang average.

And let’s be honest — if [Arsenal](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1) being top playing haram ball possession control sideways recycling football is proof of anything, it’s that the standard isn’t what people pretend it is. If that’s what’s dominating, what does that say?

Put someone like [Luis Enrique](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2) in charge with proper tactical authority and elite structure and we’d walk this trash league. Comfortably. Because once you add real technical and tactical authority, the cracks show.

And don’t forget — when it comes to actual elite football, the [La Liga](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3) has been setting the standard in the [UEFA Champions League](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4) for years. That’s the real benchmark. Not TV money. Not “top 8 finishes.” Not social media engagement.

Finishing top 8 in a league phase means absolutely nothing. It’s not a trophy. You qualify for knockouts — that’s it. No one frames a “Top 8” [certificate.You](http://certificate.You) either win it or you don’t.

This obsession with metrics and placements instead of silverware is exactly the problem.

Also let’s talk about the money. Clubs in the [Premier League](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3) get ridiculous revenue just for existing. Massive TV deals. Parachute payments. Commercial hype. And what do most of them do? Aim for “top half” and survival. No ambition to win anything. Just vibes and PR statements.

This whole “most physical league” narrative? What does that even mean? Half the players go down when someone brushes their shoulder. It’s fake intensity marketed as authenticity.

Financially dominant and elite at PR? 100%

He said: 'I hope people will say I was a good goalkeeper.'

Yet every time a keeper pulls off an incredible save, fans still call it PRIME NEUER. THE STANDARD.

Even in Europe’s toughest competitions, true legends are remembered for their character as much as their skill.

1r43bj2,Evra’s legendary UCL story about unity still resonates &amp; here’s why,RSDFitness,12,4,2026-02-14 03:32:23,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1r43bj2/evras_legendary_ucl_story_about_unity_still/,"One of the most memorable non‑match moments in Champions League lore comes from Patrice Evra, talking about how a group of players from very different backgrounds, different countries, religions, and races, became brothers during Manchester United’s European campaign.

Before a big UCL match, Sir Alex Ferguson reportedly told them they’d already won, not because of skill alone, but because of the unity they had built. 

That moment wasn’t just about tactics, it was about respect, togetherness, and belief.
It’s interesting to revisit this now because there’s been a lot of cultural conversation recently about diversity and belonging in society.

Evra’s story is a reminder of what unity feels like when a team truly comes together, no matter where anyone came from, and how that bond helped them lift the UCL trophy.

What other moments in Champions League history stand out to you as examples of teamwork, unity, or stories that go beyond just the scoreline? 

Why do you think those narratives resonate with fans years later?

The first leg was played at Camp Nou, where Guardiola’s Barcelona displayed total attacking football, while Guus Hiddink’s Chelsea showed disciplined, rock-solid defending. Barcelona controlled the game, but Chelsea successfully isolated Lionel Messi and Xavi.

The London side played extremely aggressively, something the Catalans later described as 'against the spirit of football.'There were controversial decisions even in the first match. The Catalans felt too few yellow cards were shown to Chelsea players (both teams received 2 each), and complained that Chelsea had 'kicked their game to pieces.'The match eventually ended in a goalless draw, which gave Chelsea reason to be optimistic ahead of the return leg at home.

May 10. 2009. London.

This date will live forever in the memory of Chelsea fans. 

And one name: Tom Henning Øvrebø

9.min.:

 Michael Essien scored an unbelievable  thunderbolt that put the hosts in the perfect position. Chelsea deliberately gave up possession and, for the rest of the match, kept creating clear cut chances.

Then...

23.min.: 

Dani Alves pulled down Florent Malouda inside the penalty area. Øvrebø saw the foul, but awarded a free kick.

26.min.: 

Eric Abidal clearly held back Didier Drogba inside the box, but the whistle stayed silent.

82. min.: 

Next to Nicolas Anelka, Gerard Piqué very clearly and indisputably handled the ball inside the penalty area. It was one of the most obvious mistakes, something the defender himself later admitted.

96. min.:

With the score already 1-1, Michael Ballack shot struck Samuel Eto’o on the arm. Ballack furiously chased the referee across the pitch, but no penalty was given.

After the chaos following the match, Drogba was banned for three matches, Bosingwa for two, and Chelsea were fined 85.000 pounds by UEFA for the players behaviour.

Pirlo (Milan), Xabi Alonso, Kroos, Modrić, every great Ancelotti/Madrid team had a brain in midfield.

Pass and move. Drop deep. Recycle possession. Control chaos.

Running is important, yes… but runners alone don’t control games. This isn’t an athletic race.

Since Kroos and Modrić departure, control in midfield has dropped, especially against low blocks and elite opponents. Legs are there, intensity is there, but the tempo control isn’t. Madrid has always needed a thinker in midfield, and the gap is obvious now.

So here’s my question to Madridistas:

If Madrid signs two midfielders next season:

\- One starter (to control tempo).

\- One rotational/sub option.

Which TWO players fit Real Madrid best?

Examples of profiles I’m thinking about:

\- Rodri-type controller; 

\- Vitinha/Kimmich-style tempo manager;

\- Frenkie/Pedri-type intelligent carrier; or a surprise, underrated option.

Who starts? Who comes off the bench? 

And why that player fits Madrid’s identity?

Also, there are 2 notable players that could've made either XI, I have decided to put Ronaldo Nazario in the 20th Century team as I think his best years were between 1996 and 2000, and Zinedine Zidane goes into the 21st Century team because, while his best year was probably 1998, I'd say his peak was 1998-2003 which is 1 more year of his peak in the 21st Century. Anyway, these are the teams.  

EDIT - Van Basten goes to the bench and Eusebio out of the team because I somehow didn't think of putting Pele in.     

EDIT - I have put Paolo Maldini into the 20th Century XI and removed him from the 21st Century team as his prime was moreso in the 20th Century, so Facchetti is no longer in the team and Roberto Carlos now starts with Fabio Cannavaro now making the team on the bench.

1r1046o,Modern football is so entertaining.,Abject_Rise_9025,4,6,2026-02-10 18:01:50,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1r1046o/modern_football_is_so_entertaining/,"(I wrote the content in Chinese, but used AI to translate it.)

Modern football is genuinely amazing!

First, the obsession with goalkeepers ""playing with their feet."" Every keeper now — good at it or not — has to take touches, play short passes, and basically invite the press. Is it actually useful for the team? Not always. You constantly see defenders pass it back, the keeper fluffs the control or the pass goes wrong, it gets intercepted, and suddenly it's an open goal for the opposition. Even so-called world-class keepers do this all the time now. Mistakes that used to be rare (maybe once every few seasons) are happening in almost every game, including massive matches. One stupid error completely changes the whole game.

*Processing img 040p0arypbig1...*

It's honestly so dumb. I bet in a few years keepers will just go back to launching it long and everyone will be happier.

Thanks to VAR, handball rules are much more lenient now — it's not an automatic penalty just because the ball touches an arm. But as a result, every defender in or near the box starts doing this cringey ""ice-skating"" lunge/slide: legs splaying out everywhere, body twisting and flailing awkwardly like they're about to fall over, looking super clumsy and brainless. Defending has turned into some weird, embarrassing performance art.

*Processing img fk1rd2fzpbig1...*

When a free kick is awarded near the box, the defending team always sticks one player flat on the ground behind the wall to ""block the low shot."" Has anyone actually checked the stats — how many low free kicks were scoring before this became trendy? The bigger problem is how dangerous it is for the guy lying there: his back is facing the wall, he has zero clue what's coming — someone could fall backward and land on him, or the ball could deflect straight into his head/face. It's completely irresponsible for player safety.

*Processing img yahav720qbig1...*

Since the pandemic brought 5 subs in 3 windows, teams invented ""self-made time-outs."" Mid-first half (25–30 mins) or second half (60+ mins), not due to heat or anything, suddenly the keeper ""gets injured"" (keeper down = full stop, no continuing play). Whole team gathers on the sideline for tactical instructions, players chug energy gels, game pauses 1–2 mins. It's become this weird accepted norm — unspoken agreement between teams.

Worst part? Water breaks (mandatory in hot games, but if it's cold they skip it... so teams just fake a heavy injury instead). Keeper or someone flops dramatically, everyone walks to the sideline for water, chats, gets instructions. Why did football suddenly add this random ""anytime tactical timeout"" rule? So idiotic. And don't forget: 5 subs already, plus concussion subs (extra one), plus more in extra time. The game's turning into stop-start nonsense with added time going forever because of all these breaks.

*Processing img p11hamc6qbig1...*

*Processing img dwps7xp0qbig1...*

*Processing img w6dfgf41qbig1...*

while we're on VAR... don't even get me started on those insane ""body hair level"" or ""toenail offside"" decisions. Goals getting chalked off because some guy's armpit or a millimetre of shoulder is fractionally ahead — no real advantage gained, but VAR draws the lines and kills the moment anyway. It's pedantic to the extreme, sucking the joy out of what should be exciting plays. VAR always produces a lot of funny situations. Take the 25/26 Man City vs Liverpool game: City player goes down in the box, City regain possession and look to counter, winger thinks about it and kicks it out but not anyone assuming injury?, ref checks VAR... suddenly it's a penalty for City (which they missed anyway). 

*Processing img rd9x05fnqbig1...*

And don't even get me started on all the trendy jargon fans throw around: ""false 9"", ""9.5"", ""6 playing higher as an 8"", ""high press"", ""half-spaces"", ""left-footed right-winger cutting inside""...

Yeah, modern football is so entertaining."

I’m mainly thinking about:

\* contract situations and expectations about his role (superstar status vs team project),

\* relationships with coaches/teammates (on-pitch behavior, dressing room dynamics, leadership, ego),

\* the influence of PR, entourage, and fan/media pressure,

\* the difference between: “difficult personality” vs “elite ambition + superstar leverage.”

Guiding questions:

1. In which club (if any) do you think there were the strongest signs of an actual issue—not just headlines?

2. Can the controversial moments be explained by football reasons (tactics/role/results), or were they mostly off-field?

3. How do you personally separate “hard negotiations/confidence” from “hurting team chemistry”?

1r1bub9,Ramos is the most overrated CB of all time.

Ramos routinely made errors, either pushing up too far to man mark the 9 (thus leaving space in behind) or being too reckless with his tackling. 

I'm not saying Ramos isn't an all time great, but he isn't the best CB of all time like people here say. Pique is likely one of the most underrated CBs ever. He wasn't great in the Barca UCL collapses from 2018-2020, but he consistently was the best defender and had to carry a backline which was very high up and would usually have to below average defense fullbacks (Alba and Roberto weren't great defenders).

Currently, the **UEFA Europa League (UEL)** and **UEFA Europa Conference League (UECL)** matches are staggered on the same day. (Thursdays)

**The current problems:**

1. **Split attention** — Fans, broadcasters, and media have to choose between matches from both competitions, usually prioritizing the more established UEL. 
2. **Perceived “second-tier” status** — The UECL can be overshadowed, especially when bigger names are playing in the UEL at the same time.
3. **Broadcast constraints** — TV channels might only show one competition in a given slot in certain markets, limiting exposure for UECL, less viewers.

**Arguments for separating them into different weeks:**

* **Undivided spotlight**: If UECL had its own exclusive matchweek, it could get more standalone media attention, better prime broadcasting slots, and potentially higher attendance/viewership for its games.
* **Brand-building**: Helps establish the UECL as a distinct competition rather than a “side show” to UEL.
* **Better exposure for smaller clubs**: This competition is meant to spotlight teams and leagues that don’t usually get the stage. Many UECL clubs have less global reach; A clear week of focus could boost their visibility.

Ribéry in his absolute chaos era, Luca Toni scoring for fun (39 goals in all competitions), Lahm in his prime, Schweinsteiger still raw but dangerous, Kahn in his final elite season, plus a very Hitzfeld-style balance between pragmatism and experience.

His first touch alone separates him from most players. He could kill any ball dead, under pressure, on the touchline, in big Champions League games. That first touch is what let him slow games down, draw defenders in, and decide when to actually hurt teams.

He wasn’t about pace or chaos. He played with control. Watch how often he’d receive the ball, pause, and suddenly the whole defence is on strings. That kind of winger barely exists now, especially in the Premier League.

And when it mattered, he showed up. Knockouts, semis, finals, title run-ins — managers trusted him in those moments for a reason. He made football look easy on the hardest nights.

Compare that to someone like Salah. Great output, fair enough. But it’s a completely different type of winger. Much more direct, much more reliant on volume. Effective, yes — but nowhere near the same level on the eye. Mahrez played with touch, patience, and intelligence.

Add in what he did internationally as well — actually leading his country and winning trophies — and it’s crazy he’s not in the top-tier winger conversations.

Not many wingers had that level of first touch, control, and big-game calm.

Mahrez was different.

On one hand, it’s a nice way for European minnows to make it to the UCL knockouts. On the other hand, it feels like a safe spot or a second chance for the any team, especially the giants, to drop down into, if they have a horrendous campaign. Without the KO playoff round, it adds to the drama and excitement on the final day and makes everything more fun and elite, but at the same time from a sporting perspective, whats the difference between placing 1st and 16th now without any byes (hosting the second leg and having an easier opponent might be the difference?). I feel like the KO playoffs are cool, but the format already caters to small teams by having them play an opponent only once; giving them a safe zone is just a little bit too much, especially when a big team or a team that just isn’t good enough can sneak in and be rewarded with a second chance in the next round after dropping stinkers. It’s like if we still had a group stage, the equivalent would be if the 3rd place teams could go through, begging the question for why they are going through, and why is more than half of the league entering the KOs except for the bottom/worst teams??

By the way, if there was no KO playoff round, and everything was properly seeded, these would’ve been the games for last season and this season.

It isn’t. There’s no trophy for it. No one gets remembered for league-phase tables. All that matters is qualifying for the knockouts. What makes it worse is how these teams play. So many Prem sides are boring, robotic, and system-dependent. Heavy reliance on set pieces, rehearsed patterns, and transition football. Very little real technical quality. It’s mostly pace, power, and athleticism, not football intelligence.

That style looks great in league formats and group phases. It flatters stats. But in knockouts — against elite, technical sides — it gets exposed.

Perfect example: Liverpool. Finished 1st in the league phase, got all the praise, all the graphics, all the hype… and then went out in the Round of 16 to PSG — who went on to win the whole [thing.So](http://thing.So) what did finishing first actually get them? Nothing.

That’s the point Prem fans refuse to accept: where you finish means nothing as long as you qualify. The Champions League is about matchups, moments, and technical quality under pressure — not spreadsheet dominance.

This obsession with league-phase placements just feels like cope. If the Premier League is really that far ahead, prove it in May, not November. Real European giants don’t flex tables. They flex Champions League trophies.

Until Prem clubs dominate finals — not set-piece xG charts — the hype is massively overstated.

Messi grew up in the team he plays for, with the team-mates he plays with. Cristiano arrived in England at a giant team in crisis, which was only losing. He had to grow over the last two years with this team under construction.

Messi plays as a number 9 in about 50 square meters, closer to the goal and with less defensive work. Cristiano, on the other hand, is a winger. How can a winger score the same number of goals as a centre forward?

A winger who defends, who ends a game in the 94th minute running after Pedro in a goal-scoring situation. A winger who, in set pieces, reaches his own area 20 times because he is very important to the defence. A player who is not protected by anything or anyone… It is much, much harder to be Cristiano, let’s stop joking.”

Edit : *Many reposts (including Marca recently) phrase it as Ronaldo arriving “in England at a giant team in crisis,” but checking the original 2012 interview, it’s: “Cristiano came from England to a team that was losing. He had to grow up in the past two years with this team in construction.*”

1qw2ro6,Ranking the best 18 performing clubs in the history of the competition (1955-2025) in terms of consistency and deep runs.,Andresk99,24,29,2026-02-05 03:12:50,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qw2ro6/ranking_the_best_18_performing_clubs_in_the/,"Most all-time club and team debates rely solely on titles won, which I strongly value a lot, but that often ignores something just as important in football history: consistency at the highest level across multiple seasons. There is already a point system which tries to emulate a typical league performance based on number of games won (win = 3 pts, draw = 1 pt, loss = 0 pts). [https://www.transfermarkt.com/uefa-champions-league/ewigeTabelle/pokalwettbewerb/CL](https://www.transfermarkt.com/uefa-champions-league/ewigeTabelle/pokalwettbewerb/CL) However, clubs can benefit from the newer formats which includes more matches due to the group stages. The original European Cup was strictly a KO tournament.

Instead, I built a system that rewards how deep a club goes in the European Cup/UCL over time. The deeper the run, the more points you get from each edition. I calculated it by the following formula:

**Total Points = 1×APP + 2×QF + 3×SF + 4×F + 5×W**

Where:

* APP = Participation / First Round
* QF = Quarter final appearance
* SF = Semifinal appearance
* F = Final appearance
* W = Champion

The competition's formats have varied over time with a group stage introduced in the late 1990s, a second group stage, the round of 16, and the most recent KO play-offs. I included only the rounds that have been present in all editions since its inception. 

I built this table to notice the gap among different clubs in history and to have a deeper analysis from the competition's top performers, and I concluded:

1. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are undoubtedly the two greatest clubs in the history of the competition.

2. 3rd spot has four competitors: AC Milan, Barcelona, Liverpool, and Juventus. Very close gap among them, and the four clubs have reached at least one final across 5 different decades.

3. Benfica is surprisingly one of the most consistent and top performing clubs in UCL. They are literally closer to Manchester United, Ajax, Internazionale level of greatness than the new rich oil clubs. Porto may have won 2 Europa Leagues and an Intercontinental Cup, but their rivals have performed a lot better in Europe's top competition.

4. PSG and Manchester City will need many more deep runs and a few more trophies to be considered historic giants.

5. Nottingham Forest being European champions is the equivalent of Greece winning the Euros.

And God forbid for a footballer to be so complete, I don't even know why he can play at world class level at every attacking role, ST, wings, CAM, even as a deep playmaker, some times even defensively.

His highlight is also a joy to watch, elite stamina, mentality, short-long range assists, lethal instinct, bicycle, tackling, scoring goals from 50 metres... this man can walk into any XI and instantly make them look twice as strong.

Football has Goats in every position such as Messi, Cr7, Pele in attack, Zidane, Xavi in midfield,... But for me personally, if I were to establish an all time XI, Rooney may not be the absolutely best at a specific position, he is a name I mention first if I want my team to play as a team, not individuals.

He is a joy to watch man."

Huge money, massive marketing, but on the pitch a lot of it looks sterile — the same risk-averse systems, the same patterns, very little variety. Yet it’s constantly sold as the unquestioned “peak” of the sport.

Premier League fans love throwing around the term “farmers league,” but if that’s the case, why has La Liga dominated European competition for decades? And why do English clubs spend hundreds of millions every year buying the best players from these so-called inferior leagues?

There’s also a clear difference in standards. In Spain, Italy, or Germany, winning actually matters. If you don’t deliver trophies, you’re gone. In England, “trust the process,” finishing top four, and getting a Netflix documentary seems to be enough to buy endless patience.

Midtable clubs in other leagues still fight for cups. In the Premier League, clubs openly sell their best players and sacrifice cup runs just to “secure midtable” or protect their league position. Where’s the ambition in that?

Even the manager culture is strange. In the Premier League, trophy-winning or proven managers get binned quickly, while “project” coaches with little to no winning pedigree are recycled endlessly. You see coaches who’ve actually won things being pushed out, only to be replaced by safe, compliant options who fit the PR narrative rather than raise standards.

At the end of the day, trophies are what count. League position without silverware means very little. By that metric, La Liga still sets the benchmark in Europe.

So what do people think?

Non-English fans — do you see the Premier League as mostly hype and marketing over substance?

Premier League fans — is it truly the best league in football, or just the best-sold one?

1qthydu,The disapointment of the tournament in every year of this decade so far,Greedy_Net_1803,20,28,2026-02-02 07:00:14,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qthydu/the_disapointment_of_the_tournament_in_every_year/,"Basically, the team that went out most anti-climactically in proportion to the expectations they had. In my opinion it's pretty much:

2020: **Liverpool**'s 'almost centurions' who played impossible heavy metal football and walked the league going out against Atleti. We all remember that Adrian game, what an unlucky day it was for him for real.

2021: **Bayern** with prime Lewa in plain Ballon dor level failing their title defense prematurely against the sting of sweet revenge from PSG for the final prior.

2022: **PSG** with MNM trio choking a 2 goal lead against Madrid at the death. I know Madrid were the eventual champions but the way they went out was truly nasty considering their squad.

2023: This was the hardest one because this one didn't actually have any notorious disappointments, so I went with **Napoli**. This was easily the best Napoli season of all time, even by Maradona era standards. They dominated the league so easily with Kvara and Osimhen tormenting defenses for fun that people actually had them in the cards for reaching semis or the final in their side of the bracket. But went out in an amazing tie with Milan putting a Pioli signature defensive masterclass. Man that year was so epic for Serie A for real; seeing a Milan derby in semis again after 20 years was truly special.

2024: This one was easily **Inter**; the sub-champions walked the league so easily that year that it was heavily expected for them to reach the final again on their side of the bracket. But went out against Atleti in the first KO after missing a ton of chances. Simeone ball always seems to take a big favorite as victim, for real.

2025: Many will think Liverpool again but nah, it was **Real Madrid**. Until this point Madrid was at least reaching the semis every year in the decade, which is what's expected from them. And to go out like this, with the Rice Rice meme that was like a copy paste freekick was something else. All the merit to Arsenal and especially to Rice for that double beauty though."

In Barcelona’s locker room, the atmosphere was reportedly quiet and polite, but Zlatan’s intensity shifted the mood instantly. 

Messi reportedly smiled, but Zlatan’s stare reminded everyone who commanded the room.

Stories like these show how top players can influence not only matches but the mentality of entire teams in elite competitions like the Champions League. 

How important do you think aura and leadership are for teams competing at the highest level?

Which players today carry a similar influence?”

He's a striker that doesn't generate enough xG for himself because he lacks the ability to threaten CBs physically nor is he reliable much at running in behind, hence why he plays a lot as a second striker and/ or ""10"". You could criticise Atletico's lack of chance creation when he does play uptop but I feel there's enough sample size from him in big games where he literally just doesn't worry the opposition's CBs much if it's not a long shot outside the box, and when he played striker for City (a good number of games when Haaland was out too, he had a legitimate run where you can't use the lack of rhythm excuse either).

First: pure eye candy. His dribbling had hips like a salsa dancer, touches softer than silk, control that made defenders look silly. Creating chances, passing, everything was elegant. Joy to watch. Peak artistry.

Remember peak Ronaldo-Messi debate era? We huddled in hostel rooms for UCL nights Messi fans versus Ronaldo fans yelling. One mate was Isco fan. That is how magnetic he was.

Second: big games. He owned them. Giorgio Chiellini said Isco wrecked Juventus’ UCL plans: all their tactics destroyed. Verratti called him one of the best opponents ever even Messi could not do what Isco did to him. The 2016-17 UCL run? Isco was the creative spark.

Even at 2018 World Cup for Spain (Iniesta and Silva’s last dance), Isco was the guy. Attacks flowed through him, central hub despite the veterans. Spain went out to Russia on penalties, but he bossed it.

100% Spot on: Arsenal 1st, Bayern 2nd, Liverpool 3rd, Pafos 26th

I predicted Man City to finish 6th (8th), Barcelona to finish 7th (5th). Correctly predicted 5/8 top 8 teams to qualify as top 8.

Other pretty close calls: Predicted Inter to finish 11th (10th), Atletico to finish 12th (14th), Newcastle to finish 15th (12th), Juventus 17th (13th), Atalanta 18th (15th), Monaco 20th (21th), Qarabag 23th (22th)

Not terrible results:

* Spurs and PSG finished pretty much the other way around of what I predicted. I had predicted Spurs 10th (4th) and PSG 4th (11th)
* Same as Real Madrid 5th (9th) and Chelsea 9th (6th)
* Galatasaray finished 20th instead of my 13th prediction, but after their opening games, I never expected them to get 0 points against USG and Monaco.
* Benfica 29th instead of 24th, but I mean, come on, nobody expected them to put 4 past Real Madrid with a GK header qualifying them in the last minute, lol.

Where I got cooked:

* Sporting finished 12 places higher than I had predicted them (7th vs 19th)
* Olympiacos finished 10 places higher than my prediction
* Dortmund and Marseille finished 9 places lower
* Athletic Club finished 7 places lower 
* And last but not least, Napoli finished 16 places lower than my prediction (14th vs 30th) and Villareal 14 places lower (21th vs 35th)

Overall my top 15-17 predictions were pretty solid apart from including Napoli and not including Sporting. But after that, there are a lot of bad predictions. I overrestimated some top 5 league teams that turned out to be terrible like Villareal or Napoli. "

1qrciwn,Looking for a few small football groups to try something for a week.,Amazing_Case_8029,2,2,2026-01-30 22:49:38,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qrciwn/looking_for_a_few_small_football_groups_to_try/,"Hey - I’m building MatchSquad and I’m looking for a few people to try it in a very specific way.

This is mainly for fans who already have 2–4 people they watch / talk football with (friends, siblings, a small group chat). If that’s you, I’d love for you to try it for a week and tell me honestly if it makes your football conversations more fun or not.

It’s built for small private groups - not a public forum, not a place to meet strangers.

What it does:

* A private squad space for your group (text + voice)
* A persistent “lounge” to talk anytime
* Match-specific “matchrooms” for individual games, where you can react together around that match

It’s early-stage and I want real feedback to shape it. If you try it, you can reply here or message me directly and I’ll respond.

If your group wants to keep a specific vibe (banter, analysis, casual), you can invite people accordingly and keep it tight.

If anyone’s up for being an early experimenter, I can share the links in the comments or via DM.

**Why not just use a whatsapp group chat?**  
Totally fair question, and if WhatsApp already works for your group, there’s no point switching just for the sake of it.

The only real advantages MatchSquad aims to offer (now + where it’s going) are:

1. **Football stays football-only, with match context** A WhatsApp group is just a stream of messages. MatchSquad is organised around your squad and your matches, so it’s easier to keep “the football thread” separate from everything else, and to drop in before/after a match without scrolling through unrelated stuff.
2. **Matchday reactions can be time-synced (spoiler-safe)** In WhatsApp, if someone is 1–5 minutes ahead or behind, you either spoil each other or you hold back. MatchSquad matchrooms are built so reactions are tied to the minute of the match and can play/ping when you hit that same moment. That’s the one thing a generic chat app doesn’t do.
3. **It can become your group’s football memory, not just chat history** (forward-looking) The longer-term bet is that it won’t just be “messages”. Over time it can surface things like:
   * “Last time you played this fixture, here’s what your squad predicted / said”
   * your pre-match takes vs what actually happened
   * your best/worst reactions across a season WhatsApp technically “stores” history, but it doesn’t turn it into something usable or meaningful.

So the honest answer is: **today it’s only worth switching if football chat is a real habit for your group** (and you like the idea of having it in a dedicated place, plus the option of spoiler-safe matchday reactions). If you just occasionally send a few texts during games, WhatsApp is probably enough."

While the league system seems to be congested enough that the majority of teams still have something to play for on the final day, it would be even more competitive, and more fair, if the highest remaining seed were always guaranteed to play the lowest remaining seed, the 2nd highest to play the 2nd lowest, and so on. Plus, having a knockout round draw at all given how limited it is now just feels a bit pointless. To give context, I’ve made a little spreadsheet showing the ties that we’d have had in each round of last year’s CL knockouts if this system were put into place - of course I cannot say who would have won the new ties, so I am limited to only using teams to have actually qualified for each round. Anyone agree, or have thoughts about whether or not it would be an improvement?

Playoffs: Atalanta vs Brugge, Dortmund vs Sporting, Real Madrid vs Man City, Bayern vs Celtic, Milan vs Juventus, PSV vs Feyenoord, PSG vs Brest, Benfica vs Monaco

Still, he had a good career overall."

They’ve shown that classic cup DNA before, like their iconic win over Barcelona and dismantling PSG in the Club World Cup, and their recent 3-2 win away at Napoli is not a small feat against a strong team. Liam Rosenior is doing solid work, and reports say the dressing room feels much happier and freer under him than the more rigid Enzo Maresca era. All the key players are in form right now: Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo anchoring midfield reliably, the Brazilian duo of Estevao and Joao Pedro shining brightly, Cole Palmer back adding silky tempo, and Reece James with Marc Cucurella holding steady at full-back. Only the center-backs and goalkeeper feel a bit inconsistent and less reliable, but when Chelsea click, their attack plays super lightly and dangerously.

I truly feel bad for Xabi. He was given half a year, managing a bunch of spoilt players who think too highly of themselves and refuse to train hard and put themselves in a discipline system.

Now, Alonso is already out, Madrid genius players can now play freely as they want, without any system. As we saw they did against Benfica yesterday. Good luck."

“To make schedule difficulty visible after the fact, I use a simple measure: average opponent points across the league phase. If your eight opponents collectively earned a lot of points, your schedule was hard; if they didn’t, it was easier.

“To adjust the table, I add (or subtract) the difference between a team’s average opponent points and the league average from that team’s raw points. The adjustment is deliberately modest. It doesn’t try to re-decide outcomes; it clarifies the conditions under which those outcomes were produced.

“That’s it. No black box, no hidden parameters.”

A few spoilers: PSG move way up and Tottenham and City drop down quite a bit when adjusting for opponent points. "

Benfica as everyone knows for the past 7 years is going trough a really bad situation , we constantly sell our best players and buy players that are inferior to those that we sold

This allied to the constant changes in coach and poor results and exhibitions really Kills any motivation.

However its in this moments supporters and fans need to stand up and show that they are together and with the team to the end.

Yesterday we showed that , allways with the team and i believe the players felt our energy.

Prestianni and scheldrup made the game of their lives.

I wish pavlidis learned how to finish easy chances and dedic learned how to drible others and not himself, but those are things that with hard work can be improved.

However i can say that difense wise we are much better , pressing better , closing spaces (tho those 2 real Madrid goals were goals that completely exposed our defense and where we need to improve)

Offensively wise , we have much to improve when we have the game , we can see that alot when we play for the league against teams that Stay in the back and we cant simply go for the counters.

Anyway the last time that i felt this good was when Simão Sabrosa scored the 2-1 against Liverpool.

What a night.

Related to Real Madrid, in Spain they are probably the team i hate the most (i have a soft spot for valencia ).

However we can see how they arent even close to what they were , they went from having teams that could rival anyone anywhere , to having a team full of Youth  but dont know what needs to be done to Win a Champions league.

Also sending Xabi away was probably their worst decision ever , he knows what is needed to win and have real Madrid written all Over him , if given enough time he would have made this real Madrid team into real winners."

I found a gap in the market as existing sites that do this look historical and I feel like I could make a site that was more modern, clean, and to the point.

Features include:

* Live Fixtures
* Live scores
* Live line-ups when they are released
* Upcoming fixtures
* Global Broadcasters &amp; channels
* Mobile support
* Live event data

I already have accurate TV data working, but I don’t want to overbuild.

– Do you care more about speed or detail?  
– Would you rather search by team or by channel?  
– What’s missing from current football TV listing sites?

1qqzq19,We need to have an honest discussion about Jude Bellingham,Specialist_Scheme535,0,96,2026-01-30 13:19:08,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qqzq19/we_need_to_have_an_honest_discussion_about_jude/,"I got downvoted into oblivion for saying this on the Real Madrid sub, but honestly is anyone genuinely shocked by that result? What’s the point of splashing €100 million on a bloke who spends half the match chasing his own first touch like a lost puppy, contributes next to nothing, and somehow gets away with absymal perfomances every week? Arda Güler had every right to be furious the one player actually creating chances, the only genuine creative outlet, gets hooked, while Jude Bellingham survives yet another dreadful performance untouched. ***Why? Because he ran a lot, stained his shorts, and will no doubt post a corny Instagram story with a motivational quote about “mentality” by morning. A hundred million for someone supposedly the best young midfielder in the world, yet incapable of threading the most basic passes. Every touch becomes a duel, possession is constantly lost, and when it goes wrong he’s straight in the referee’s ear despite it being his own mistake. It’s exhausting.*** I’m tired of people pretending he’s world-class, because it does a disservice to actual world class players. **Jude is a workhorse**, I’ll grant him that, but he is not a world-class midfielder because if he is, then what are Pedri, Cherki, a declining Isco, or KDB meant to be? Madrid never needed him from a footballing perspective; commercially perhaps, tactically absolutely not. **This team has always needed a controller. He’s dreadful in the final third, ineffective in the middle, which begs the obvious question what exactly is he good at? Versatile, yes, but mediocre everywhere.** Don’t tell me he carried us to the Champions League or La Liga he didn’t. Kroos and Modrić did. They were the glue. Stop hiding behind team trophies and argue his footballing ability. For an attacking midfielder, he’s painfully limited. Don’t bring up stats either they never tell the full story. Watch the game and you’ll see it a tremendous athlete, a relentless engine, but little else. And when you already have three workhorses in Camavinga, Tchouaméni and Jude, the balance collapses. You can’t play him deep, you can’t play him as a true AM, you can’t hide him anywhere. At best he’s a super-sub or a second striker. In my opinion, Madrid would’ve been better off backing genuine world-class midfielders like Isco or Modrić instead but shirts don’t sell themselves, do they?

In my view, the English media were desperate for a global footballing icon, and when Bellingham arrived at the biggest club on earth, the narrative wrote itself regardless of substance. We’re being sold a manufactured lie."

Haaland is making incredible runs constantly, but nobody is pulling the trigger on the pass!

​Doku connected with him once, but where are the others? It feels like the rest of the team is terrified to play a lob, a through ball, or a cross unless it’s a 100% guarantee. Is this the downside of Pep’s system? The control is great, but it feels like it kills the instinct to take risks.

​Honestly, if I’m Haaland, I’m looking at Real Madrid and thinking I’d be better off there. They play with flair and don't think twice before sending a direct ball. I’m a City fan first and always will be, but I’m genuinely worried. When the Pep era ends, I hope we get a manager who instills enough belief in the players to just try the risky pass again.

​Does anyone else feel like we are wasting Haaland’s best attributes right now?"
1qq6lxy,Why is everybody ignoring the fact that Benfica were helped massively by the referee?,Guerrrillla,0,29,2026-01-29 16:56:41,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qq6lxy/why_is_everybody_ignoring_the_fact_that_benfica/,"I saw the score last night and couldn't believe it, was so excited about Benfica knocking out Real from the top 8 and making it to the next round, where they'll probably face each other again. 

But today I checked the highlights and now it feels a bit bittersweet. That penalty wouldn't have been given 9 out of 10 times. If you give a penalty every time players push each other during corner kicks then every corner kick would be a penalty. But let's assume that's a foul. Maybe that's debatable. As well as Rodrygo's second yellow.

What really surprised me though, was the foul that led to Benfica's last goal. I swear I've watched the replay about 10 times and I still don't understand how that was given as a foul for them. Bellingham takes the ball fair and square without touching Aursnes at all, Aursnes kicks Bellingham, falls down, and the referee gives a foul to... \*\*\*checks notes\*\*\* Benfica?! Absolutely atrocious call.

And I find it a bit weird that nobody seems to be talking about this. I guess everyone's obsessed with the underdog knocking down the giant and they're too hyped up to be objective.

I'm rooting against Madrid as much as the next guy, but this feels unfair. And yeah, you could say that Benfica had loads of chances and could have scored more, but that's the thing, they didn't. A match is won by scoring goals, and fairness should be objective."

Take the last World Cup: Argentina was on the ropes after the Saudi upset. But with 48 teams, big teams won’t feel that same pressure after a loss because third place is enough to get through.Take Spain’s group in the last World Cup as an example. It went right down to the wire—until the final moments of the last match, Japan, Germany, and Spain were all simultaneously on the verge of either advancing or being knocked out. 48 teams format just takes away the drama."

Because tomorrow there will be some chaos and I wanted know the potential scenarios before watching the games. If I'm missing anything, please let me know.

(I ""translated"" the following storylines to GPT so I'm sorry if there is any weird wordings.). But list and descriptions are 100% mine. Here it is:

**18- Arsenal v Kairat**

\- It is not a critical match for either team.

**17- Liverpool v Qarabağ**

\- A win is enough for **Liverpool** to guarantee a spot in the top 8; even a draw will likely suffice.

\- It is not a critical match for **Qarabağ**.

**16- Dortmund v Inter**

**-** It is not a critical match for either team.

**15- Leverkusen v Villarreal**

**-** A point is enough for **Leverkusen** to remain in the top 24. Even if they lose, they will likely stay in the top 24.

\- A prestige match for **Villarreal**.

**14- Frankfurt v Tottenham**

**-** If **Tottenham** wins, the top 8 is guaranteed. If they draw, they still have a chance for the top 8, but it’s difficult (they would remain on 15 points).

\- A prestige match for **Frankfurt**.

**13- Ajax v Olympiacos**

\- **Ajax** will need a victory by approximately 7–8 goals to stay in the top 24 (depending on other results, a smaller margin might suffice). In any other scenario, they are eliminated.

\- If **Olympiacos** loses, they are eliminated from the top 24. A draw might be enough, but they are right on the edge—a draw may not suffice. If they win, they are guaranteed a spot in the top 24.

**12- PSV v Bayern**

**-** If **PSV** wins, they advance to the top 24. If they draw, there is an 80% chance they stay in the top 24 due to their good goal difference. If they lose, they are eliminated.

\- For **Bayern** to lose 2nd place, they must lose this match AND the goal difference gap between them and Liverpool must decrease by exactly 7 this week. This is a low probability. A draw would likely satisfy both teams.

**11- Union SG v Atalanta**

\- **Union** must win to reach the top 24; since their goal difference is poor, they may need to win by a margin.

\- **Atalanta** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and maximize their goal difference. Their chances of advancing are very low due to poor goal difference. Their rivals are \[Chelsea, Manchester City, Sporting, Barcelona, Atletico\].

**10- Pafos v Slavia**

\- **Pafos** must win to reach the top 24. However, even then, their spot won't be guaranteed. Depending on other results at the bottom of the table, they could be eliminated even with a win (9 points).

\- A prestige match for **Slavia**.

**9- Monaco v Juventus**

\- A draw will be enough for **Monaco** to stay in the top 24. If they lose, they will likely be eliminated, though they may still have a chance depending on other scores.

\- The top 8 is very difficult for **Juventus** because even if they win, they will be on 15 points. In this case, 5 out of these 6 teams \[Atletico, Manchester City, Barcelona, Sporting, Chelsea, Atalanta\] would need to lose points for Juve to make the top 8.

**8- Atletico v Bodo Glimt**

\- **Atletico** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and build goal difference. Rivals: \[Chelsea, Manchester City, Sporting, Barcelona, Atalanta\].

\- **Bodo Glimt** must win to stay in the top 24, but even a win does not guarantee it.

**7- Manchester City v Galatasaray**

\- **Manchester City** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and build goal difference. Rivals: \[Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting, Atletico, Atalanta\].

\- It is not a critical match for **Galatasaray**.

**6- Benfica v Real Madrid**

\- **Benfica** must win to stay in the top 24, but even with a win, the top 24 is not guaranteed.

\- For **Real Madrid**, a draw will likely be enough to stay in the top 8. If they win, the top 8 is guaranteed; if they lose, it depends on other teams, but they will likely drop out of the top 8 (15 points).

**5- Club Brugge v Marseille**

\- **Club Brugge** must win to stay in the top 24. If they win, they are 99% likely to stay. In any other scenario, they are eliminated.

\- If **Marseille** draws, they advance with 99% certainty. Even if they lose, they have an 80% chance of advancing with 9 points due to their good goal difference.

**4- Barcelona v Copenhagen**

\- **Barcelona** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and build goal difference. Rivals: \[Chelsea, Manchester City, Sporting, Atletico, Atalanta\].

\- **Copenhagen** must get points from this match to stay in the top 24. A draw might be enough; a win guarantees the top 24. If they lose, they are eliminated.

**3- Athletic Club v Sporting**

**-** If **Athletic Club** wins, the top 24 is guaranteed. A draw will likely be enough, but it would depend on other results. If they lose, they are eliminated.

\- **Sporting** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and build goal difference. Rivals: \[Atletico, Manchester City, Chelsea, Barcelona, Atalanta\].

**2- PSG v Newcastle**

\- **PSG** is fighting for the top 8. Since their goal difference is good, a win will be 99% sufficient. If they draw, 5 out of these 7 teams \[Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting, Manchester City, Atletico, Atalanta, Juventus\] must lose points; essentially, we can say they have to win.

\- Newcastle is also fighting for the top 8. If they win, they are almost guarenteed to make it to top 8. In any other scenario, they are out of top 8. They must win.

**1- Napoli v Chelsea**

**-** If **Napoli** loses, they are eliminated from the top 24. A draw might be enough, but they are in a very risky position; a draw may not suffice. If they win, they are guaranteed a spot in the top 24.

\- **Chelsea** is fighting for the top 8. If they and their rivals win, they must win and build goal difference. Rivals: \[Atletico, Manchester City, Sporting, Barcelona, Atalanta\].

According to what’s been attributed to Georgina Rodríguez, Ronaldo’s day starts around 6am with light exercise and hydration, followed by breakfast of fruit, eggs, and cheese.

He then does a long gym session focused on strength and conditioning, spends the afternoon resting or with family, and finishes the day with swimming before bed for recovery. 

It’s an interesting example of the discipline required to perform at Champions League level for so many years.

I found a gap in the market as existing sites that do this look historical and I feel like I could make a site that was more modern, clean, and to the point.

Features include:

* Live Fixtures
* Live scores
* Live line-ups when they are released
* Upcoming fixtures
* Global Broadcasters &amp; channels
* Mobile support
* Live event data

I already have accurate TV data working, but I don’t want to overbuild.

Question for people who actually use these apps:  
– Do you care more about speed or detail?  
– Would you rather search by team or by channel?  
– What’s missing from current football TV listing sites?

Fans who started watching football after 2015 or 2016 mostly associate Ronaldo’s free kicks with low conversion and missed attempts. That is fair for the later part of his career. His output clearly declined.

But earlier on, free kicks were a huge part of his reputation. The first time I heard about Ronaldo, he was described as a fast Manchester United winger who scored unreal knuckleball free kicks. I followed him not just for goals or dribbling, but for those moments.

I still remember collecting highlights of only his free kicks and trying to recreate them. It was not just me. YouTube from that era is full of young players attempting his stance and knuckleball technique.

And this is coming from a non Manchester United fan. Back then, whenever United won a free kick in shooting range, there was genuine fear. It felt similar to how teams react now when Arsenal win a corner.

There was a time when Ronaldo was considered among the best free kick takers in the world and compared with players like Juninho, Ronaldinho and Pirlo. That reputation did not come from nowhere.

Something changed over the years. The drop in conversion is real and his last truly iconic free kick was probably against Spain in 2018. Today he is seen as someone who might score on a good day.

For someone who watched both eras, that perception shift is huge and often overlooked."

What do you guys think?,Electrical-Policy605,0,32,2026-01-26 01:45:07,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qmuunt/a_little_improvement_on_the_cl_format_what_do_you/,"I think, CL format is ok (I'm still gonna complain too many teams in CL but it is what it is, I will accept the reality now), the one thing that need to be changed is that instead of drawing teams after the group stage, let the team pick who the want to play in the knockout and beyond. For example, teams ranked 9 to 16 get to choose which team from teams ranked 17 to 24 they want to play in the knockout round, ranked 9 team got the first pick, then ranked 10 and so on. For the fairness of the teams ranked 17 to 24, they can pick they want to play home first or awat first. Once the knockout round is over, reseed the 8 teams that won, if the higher ranked teams won the knockout round, they get to keep their seeding. If the lower ranked team won, they get to replace the seeding number of the team they beat. For example, team ranked 24 knocked out team ranked 9, they get to be the new 9th seed. (Or we can rerank the 8 winning teams based on their group stage ranking) Then, the top 8 teams repeat that same selection process again. Whether we keep this format beyond round of 16 or not I think it's still debatable but I think the higher ranked teams in the group stage should be rewarded and more teams would be incentivized to play for results in the group stage."

1qmfrrt,Mbappe is the Djokovic of our Era,Lost-Mention,0,222,2026-01-25 15:33:09,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qmfrrt/mbappe_is_the_djokovic_of_our_era/,"Just read the post about who is the next player after Messi and Ronaldo to be in the same kind of debates as them and everyone who suggested Mbappe was immediately shot down. 

It reminds of Djokovic and his rise that was initially not respected or was even hated as the whole tennis world was just so enthralled by Federer and Nadal they didn't even want to consider the possibility of anyone, least not someone so soon, competing at their level or potentially overtaking them. 

So it is with Mbappe. He's come at a time when everyone just finished crowning Messi and Ronaldo as the top 2 or 3 greatest footballers of all time and no one is really interested in having anyone challenge their status - least of all so soon. And yet, quietly perhaps, that is exactly what Mbappe has been doing for years now. 

In league, Champions league and International competitions, Mbappe's output keeps screaming GOAT levels. 

He has matched Ronaldo Nazario at 27. He has more goals than Ronaldo and Messi by his current age. 

And yet he's no Halaand (as any Madrid fan who hates that he doesn't spend enough time in the box to poach goals will tell you). He scores a lot of out of the box goals, lots of dribbling goals. Left and right foot. 

He's the leading G/A scorers in Knockouts rounds in the UCL. He's the leading scorer in finals in the World Cup final. He's two goals behind Giroud for France too scorer. As an 18yo he drove Monaco to break the PSG monopoly of the league title. 

But with all this, indications are he's just getting started. Last year was his best scoring year ever, and he's started this year on fire too. 

These are his peak years and he very well could put together 3-5 generational years of output and winning that will force everyone to begin admitting that he belongs in some very uncomfortable conversations. "

I was in college, watching the match live in our hostel room with around eight to ten people. Everyone except me was sure it wouldn’t happen. Atlético’s defence was too strong, and most believed Juventus had no real chance of a comeback.

I still remember saying I just hoped for the best. When Ronaldo scored the third goal, the room went completely silent. I was the only one celebrating and losing my mind while everyone else sat there in disbelief. That moment is something I’ll never forget.

They weren’t favourites. Not even close. That season, most people expected clubs like Man City, PSG, Bayern or Real to go all the way. Chelsea were seen more as a solid knockout team than genuine contenders.

And yet, they won it.

This isn’t to say Chelsea didn’t play well, they absolutely did, but what stood out was how they won rather than who they were on paper. Tuchel turned them into an incredibly hard team to beat in a very short time. The back three, the compact midfield, the aggressive wing-backs, and the way they closed central spaces completely neutralised elite attacks.

Look at the run:

Atlético: shut down Simeone’s structure

Real Madrid: controlled games home and away

Man City (final): tactically outplayed them, pressed Rodri/Jorginho zones, cut off De Bruyne, and never let City settle

Going into the final, almost everyone I spoke to expected City to win. Pep’s City felt inevitable that year. Even I thought City would win, but weirdly, I had a gut feeling they might bottle it again in the UCL. Not because Chelsea were flashier, but because they were more balanced and clear in their approach.

And that’s what happened. Chelsea didn’t dominate possession, didn’t rely on individual brilliance alone, they controlled space, transitions, and moments. It was one of those rare Champions League wins where tactical discipline beat star power.

In hindsight, it wasn’t an upset based on luck, it was an upset based on preparation."

1qlmfah,is R9 (Brazilian Ronaldo) overrated?,jamesandkobe,0,74,2026-01-24 18:02:39,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qlmfah/is_r9_brazilian_ronaldo_overrated/,"I see many people claiming that R9’s peak was higher than that of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but I honestly think that’s just nostalgia talking. Messi and CR7 didn't just have far greater longevity; their actual performance levels at their peaks were also superior to R9’s.

​It’s completely indefensible that R9 spent over a decade at Europe’s elite clubs and came away with only one league title and zero Champions League trophies. His goal-scoring output in his best seasons simply doesn't match the numbers put up by Messi and CR7.

​As for the World Cup, that’s entirely down to 'national pedigree' (the nationality lottery). If you put Cristiano in that 2002 Brazil squad, he wouldn't necessarily have performed any worse than R9. In fact, the Brazil coach at the time, Luiz Felipe Scolari, even stated that the best player of that 2002 squad was Rivaldo, not R9."

\- Top 2 : second leg at home at every level

\- Top 4 : avoids the other top 4 teams until semi-finals

\- Top 8 : directly qualified to the round of 16

\- Top 16 : second leg of the playoffs at home

\- Top 24 : qualified to playoffs but facing stronger opponents

\- 25th and under : eliminated, no Europa League anymore

Arsenal, 21p : top 2 guaranteed, useless game as the difference between seed 1 and seed 2 is only symbolic

Bayern, 18p : top 4 guaranteed, a draw against PSV is enough to clinch top 2

Real Madrid, 15p : top 14 guaranteed, a draw clinches top 8, a victory against Benfica clinches top 4, could get top 2 if Bayern loses

Liverpool, 15p : top 14 guaranteed, a draw clinches top 8, a victory against Qarabag clinches top 4, could get top 2 if Bayern loses and Real doesn't win

Tottenham, 14p : top 15 guaranteed, a victory clinches top 5, can get top 4 with a win against Frankfurt if a team between Real and Liverpool loses/draws, but impossible to get top 2. 

Paris and Newcastle, 13p : top 16 at least¹, a draw clinches top 15 for each (they play each other on matchday 8), a victory gets a top 6 position (at 99,9%, thanks to the high goal difference), gets top 4 with a win (by one goal is enough for Paris, by two goals for Newcastle) if two teams between Real, Liverpool and Tottenham don't win 

Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting, Man City, Atlético and Atalanta, 13p each : top 18 at least, a draw guarantees a top 16 seed, a win could get from #5 to #13 position : it's so tight I can only say that we'll do the maths during the 90 minutes.

Inter and Juventus, 12p : top 21 at least, a victory clinches top 16, almost impossible to reach top 8 (needs 6/9 non-wins from Tottenham, Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting, Man City, Atlético, Atalanta, Juventus/Inter and/or a draw between Paris and Newcastle)

Dortmund, 11p : mininum top 26 (not enough to clinch top 24 from now, but it should happen unless all teams with 8 or 9 points win), guaranteed play-offs (top 20) qualification with a draw, top 16 with a win against Inter, needs miracles to reach top 8

Galatasaray, 10p : minimum top 27 (not enough to be qualified but should be, unless a festival from Haaland), won't reach top 8, propable qualification (top 24) with a draw, top 16 guaranteed with a win

Qarabag, 10p : minimum top 27 (not enough), won't reach top 8, probable qualification with a draw, should be top 16 with a win at Liverpool (not 100% tho)

Marseille, Leverkusen and Monaco, 9p : can't reach top 8 anymore, will hope for favorable results with a draw or a loss, is qualified (top 24) with a win

Eindhoven, Bilbao, Olympiacos, Napoli and Copenhagen, 8 points : should be eliminated with a loss, will hope for favorable results with a draw that bring top 24, probable qualification with a win.
Clear advantage for Eindhoven with its positive goal average as PSV can get a draw an still stay ahead of 6 points winning teams (see below). The goid pount is that they face a team that also can be satisfied by taking a single point. Problem, it's Bayern.

Brugge, 7p : is eliminated with a loss or a draw, should be qualified (top 24) with a win against Marseille

Bodo, Benfica, Pafos, St-Gilles and Ajax, 6p : is eliminated with a loss or a draw, must win and hope favorable results to reach top 24 based on goal difference. 
Bodo has an advantage and will be the best team at 9 points with a win, even ahead of a losing Marseille. The only exception is Eindhoven with a draw.
Almost the same for Benfica, but they have to beat Real Madrid. 
Pafos, St-Gilles and Ajax are almost doomed and must win AND hope that none of Marseille, Real, Atlético, Barcelona, Chelsea, Sporting nor Juventus fails. By logic, it can happen, but football can be tricky sometimes.

Frankfurt, Prague, Villarreal and Almaty are eliminated. At least you tried, guys.

¹Only two teams between Man City, Galatasaray, Inter and Dortmund can pass Paris and Newcastle - 13 points and a strong goal difference, so, unless Paris beats Newcastle 5-0 (or losing 0-5) AND Qarabag AND Galatasaray win by +5 goals against Barcelona and City - a scenario that won't happen - NUFC and PSG can be considered clinching top 16.

Very interesting games :

\- Dortmund vs Inter : two strong teams and both have some hope to get top 8 but only with a win

\- Paris vs Newcastle : two very strong teams, top 4 is reachable for each, the loser will get out of top 8 at 95%, a draw isn't very useful

\- Brugge vs Marseille : win or go home, basically an anticipated play-offs game

Interesting games :

\- Man City vs Galatasaray : Galatasaray can pass Man City with a large win but is still in danger for qualification with a heavy loss

\- Monaco vs Juventus : Monaco can reach the top 16 or get eliminated and Juventus aims the top 8

\- Bilbao vs Sporting : a draw is a good result for noone

\- Napoli vs Chelsea : Napoli still has hope, Chelsea has to maintain their position in top 8

\- Barcelona vs Copenhagen : Copenhagen still has hope, Barcelona is close to top 8

Midly interesting games :

\- Benfica vs Real : Can Benfica annoy Madrid ?

\- Atlético vs Bodo : Can Bodo annoy Madrid ?

\- Ajax vs Olympiacos : a must win for each, but victory isn't even enough for Ajax

Mediocre games :

\- Liverpool vs Qarabag : I don't think so but will football surprise us ?

\- Eindhoven vs Bayern : a draw is a good scenario for both

\- St-Gilles vs Atalanta : you have to see the results of the others games to understand is this one is meaningful or not

\- Leverkusen vs Villarreal : a matter of ranking only

\- Pafos vs Prague : a team is almost doomed and the other one is already eliminated 

\- Frankfurt vs Tottenham : the Spurs only have things to lose 

\- Arsenal vs Almaty : will the Gunners score a double-digit ?

Main battles :

\- The top 8 : 8 (!) teams at 13 points and Tottenham at 14 points. Not winning will be sanctionned hard.

\- The top 24 : 10 points almost guarantees a top 24 seed, 9 points could offer a spot in the play-offs with a good goal difference. Problem ? 14 teams can get 9-10 points for only 8 seeds. Solution ? Win. Impossible that between 12 games involved, the results are on majority a win from the weakest team, so any victorious team can hope.

Who do you guys think the top 8 teams will be after Matchday 8 at the end of the league phase?"
1qjstko,"Ajax, lowest ranked that may still advance",[deleted],5,5,2026-01-22 17:07:16,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qjstko/ajax_lowest_ranked_that_may_still_advance/,"Ajax is currently the lowest ranked team that can still advance to the knockout stages.

Ajax is in 32nd place and needs to reach spot 24 to advance, so 8 clubs need to be passed. 11 clubs are still passable and against one of them Ajax plays directly: Olympiakos.

With a win Ajax will pass Olympiakos, and compared to the other clubs in all cases to pass them Ajax needs to win anyway. So, let's assume Ajax win their own match, then out of the 10 possible passable clubs 7 need to happen too. 

These are the scenarios:
.

Copenhagen play AWAY against Barcelona and must lose
.

Bødo/Glimt play AWAY against Atletico Madrid and must not win
.

Benfica must not win against Real Madrid
.

PSV must lose against Bayern München
.

Union St.-G. must not win against Atalanta or if they win then with 2 goals diference less than how Ajax beats Olympiakos (ex. Ajax wins 3-0 and Union wins 1-0)
.

Club Brugge must not win against Marseille
.

Pafos must not win against Slavia Praha
.

Napoli must lose against Chelsea
.

Athletic Bilbao must lose against Sporting
.

Monaco must lose against Juventus and a goal difference of 6 needs to be set straight (ex. Ajax wins 3-0 and Monaco loses 3-0)
.

Again, out of the 10 mentioned scenarios at least 7 need to happen, and in all cases Ajax needs to win their own match."

1qjcv73,Two coaching philosophies in football: system-first vs player-first — which fits which clubs?,KfiRoss,8,10,2026-01-22 03:44:09,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qjcv73/two_coaching_philosophies_in_football_systemfirst/,"I’ve been thinking a lot about two very different coaching philosophies in modern football, and I’m curious what people here think.

**1) System-first (tactical) approach**  
The idea here is that the *system comes first*.  
Players are expected to adapt to the coach’s structure, roles, and tactical principles.  
Training focuses heavily on positioning, automatisms, pressing triggers, build-up patterns, etc.  
If a player doesn’t fit the system, he’s usually replaced by one who does.

**2) Player-first (man-management) approach**  
Here, the *players come first*.  
The coach is more flexible tactically and focuses more on managing personalities, confidence, leadership, and relationships.  
The main job becomes: who needs trust, who needs pressure, who should lead, who should be protected, and how to keep the squad emotionally and mentally strong.

For me, **Manchester United after Ferguson is a great example** of a club that kept looking for “tactical system managers”, while the squad and club culture might have needed more of a strong man-manager who builds around players instead of forcing them into strict systems.  
Different styles, different identities, but the same result: instability and no clear long-term success.

On the other hand, some clubs feel naturally suited to one philosophy more than the other.  
For example:

* **Barcelona** traditionally seems built for system-first coaches who impose strong positional and tactical identities.
* **Real Madrid** often looks more suited to player-first managers who handle big personalities and let individual quality decide matches.

So I’m genuinely curious:  
👉 Do you think certain clubs are structurally better suited to one coaching philosophy over the other?  
👉 And if so — which clubs fit which approach in your opinion?

Would love to hear different perspectives on this.

This was a much-needed boost for both the players and the fans. You can literally feel the confidence coming back. If we peak at this stage of the season, we could genuinely dominate some crucial matches going forward. With this momentum, a deep UCL run and a La Liga push doesn't sound unrealistic at all. Ending the season with silverware would hit different 🤍🏆

That said… the defense still looks shaky. Against a stronger opponent, we could probably concede 2–3 goals with that kind of defensive display. We seriously need a solid CB pairing. Huijsen + Militão looks like the most balanced combo right now. Huijsen has a  very attack-minded play style and needs a proper “destroyer” type partner beside him yk someone who stays back, holds the line, and brings that old-school defensive discipline.

Up front though? Different gravy. Vini and Mbappé on their day are straight-up unstoppable. If they build proper chemistry and push each other, Europe is in trouble 💯 Hopefully Rodrygo locks in and completes the trio because when he’s on form, that attack is scary. Mastantuono is a baller for sure, but Rodrygo on his day clears, no debate. Gonzalo as a super-sub or Mbappé playing false 9 behind him could also cook 👀

 And yeah… the Trent situation is frustrating. Undeniable quality, but the constant fitness concerns are holding him back. Hopefully he can stay healthy and finally show his full potential because he’d add a whole new dimension to this team. Hopefully the injuries doesn't affect his confidence and I'm Really hoping 2026 is his comeback year.

Overall though, this felt like a statement performance. Now it’s about consistency.

What do you guys think? Are we finally clicking at the right time or am I getting carried away by the momentum? Let’s talk Madridistas 🤍⚽🔥"

Manchester City is Kim Kardashian, both winning a lot but nobody cares except for forceful media and gooners

Real Madrid is definitely Taylor Swift, be considered as greatest by general public opinion and objective accolades. Both loved and hated by many.

1qf5nse,Why does Cristiano Ronaldo receive disproportionate disrespect in best player discussions?,Diggambaran,350,1012,2026-01-17 11:17:10,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1qf5nse/why_does_cristiano_ronaldo_receive/,"This is something I’ve noticed for a long time, and I’m genuinely curious how others see it.

When pundits or ex players are asked who the greatest player of all time is, many of them say Messi. That is completely fair. Messi being considered the best footballer ever is a valid opinion, and I do not have an issue with that at all.

What confuses me is what often follows. In a lot of interviews, clips, or short form videos, after naming Messi, some pundits do not even put Cristiano Ronaldo second. Instead, they jump to R9, Zidane, Ronaldinho, or sometimes say things like Ronaldo is top ten. That is where it starts to feel less like football analysis and more like selective rewriting of history.

This is not about personal favourites. If someone says Ronaldinho or Zidane is the player they loved watching the most, that is subjective and completely fine. But when the question is specifically about the best player ever, it feels inconsistent to acknowledge Messi’s greatness while refusing to place Ronaldo right next to him. Their careers are directly intertwined. They dominated the same era, pushed each other for over a decade, and produced levels of consistency, output, and longevity that modern football has not seen before or since.

If someone believes Ronaldo is the greatest, Messi has to be second. And if someone believes Messi is the greatest, Ronaldo has to be second. Anything else feels intellectually dishonest.

A lot of the disrespect seems to come from the pure talent argument. Messi is seen as a natural genius, while players like Ronaldinho, Neymar, Zidane, and R9 are often labelled as artists or raw talents. Ronaldo, meanwhile, gets reduced to physicality, mentality, or goal scoring, as if that somehow makes him a lesser footballer. That narrative ignores what he actually was on the pitch, especially earlier in his career. His Manchester United version was an elite complete attacker, explosive, creative, dominant in one versus one situations, and capable of controlling games from wide areas. He did not lose footballing ability later on, he evolved. Turning into the most efficient finisher of his generation does not erase the rest of your skill set, it reflects intelligence and adaptation.

Yes, Ronaldo has a big ego. Yes, his personality is polarising. But judging footballing greatness based on personality rather than performance feels unfair, especially when his achievements, impact across leagues, and longevity are undeniable.

I am not arguing that Ronaldo must be ranked above Messi. I am questioning why, in discussions about the greatest player ever, he is so often pushed outside the top two, something that almost never happens to Messi. For two players who defined an entire era together, that imbalance does not make much sense to me."

He ended up giving triple the time expected, invited MrBeast to his house afterward, and continued filming more videos.

Regardless of that, Ronaldo is without a doubt a better goal scorer than Messi because of the Clutch moments he produced in Champions League - the toughest club tournament. Messi on the other hand is better goal scorer in domestic cups, super cups etc. So the conclusion is: At their peaks, Ronaldo is the better goal scorer.

Despise Ronaldo being a better goal scorer than Messi in 9 year they facing each other, Messi has better goal ratio per game/minute than Ronaldo.

This prove one uncomfortable a truth, it's way much harder to score in Premier League where Ronaldo played a significant amount of games.

So Messi having better Goal per games than Ronaldo is actually a proof that Ronaldo is the better Goal scorer.

• Riyad Mahrez: Almost feel like he hypnotises the ball when it touches his feet.

• Neymar: There is a clip he control a ball falling from around 35 meters like it's nothing while his Brazilian national teammates all failed.

• Marouane Fellaini: Best Chest Control in the Universe

• Dimitar Berbatov: Handsome and silky smooth

Got a take that goes against the grain? Think a hyped player is overrated? Believe a “boring” team is secretly elite? Have a prediction no one else agrees with? This is your soapbox. 

This thread is all about sparking discussion. You don’t have to agree — in fact, you probably *won’t*. But that’s the fun.

**Share your:**

* Overrated/underrated opinions
* Bold predictions
* Unconventional tactical takes
* Disliked popular narratives

Just remember — **disagree without disrespect**. Debate is welcome, but personal attacks, trolling, and baiting aren’t.

So, let’s hear what football opinions you’ve been keeping quiet… until now."

I'm a Real Madrid fan and I can't help but feel weird at the deadwood we have in our squad every single season. Mostly old players who used to be good back in the day, but stayed in the squad for way too long without offering anything.

Excluding youth players, this season we have Mendy who has played only 3 games (including 1 time he was subbed on after the 90th minute) and Alaba (1 start against Kairat, two games he played under 10 minutes and another he started in the league and was subbed off injured). These two players earn 35 millions annually (!!!) combined, yet they barely offer anything in the team anymore. Carvajal is also close to this category, with 3 injuries and 1 red card he has barely played for the 2nd season in a row.

In the last 4-5 seasons we used to have Mariano, Odriozola, Vallejo, Bale, Hazard, Jovic and other guys sitting on our bench and barely played.

Is there any other club with similar players?"

About the reason why Barca just like the way in the past was manipulating the La Liga results by paying refs, they are also manipulating the whole social media aspect of football.

Whether it's football, politics, spreading misinformation,... The Indians are part of a massive propoganda campaign on social media, they are paid to post whatever is sent to the telegram groups they are part of.

They get paid pennies per conversion, a conversion can be either a like/upvote, retweet or share, a comment or response, and of course posting the content they were originally told to post.

Theres well over 1m Indians that are part of this network.

It's all financed with US tax payer dollars, by Israel.

Israel has somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 of their own propoganda posters and they outsource the remainder to mainly india.

The israeli program is called ""Hasbara"" and has been around since the 1960s. Before social media it was a lot more difficult for their propoganda to reach this many people as it was more subtle through the likes of radio, Hollywood, and newspaper publishing.

You can spot these cheap shills on X, they usually have an israeli flag or a Ukrainian flag in their name/pfp. The Venezuelan flag is the newest in their arsenal as they post anti Maduro content and fake Ai/old videos of Venezuelans celebrating. 

The scale of propoganda is absolutely INSANE.

Yamal get 2nd in D'Or last year while Raphinha doesn't even get into top 3 is just one of the many many examples for it.

You and me, whether you are living in Japan, Korea, or the US,... it really doesn't matter, we are easily to be brainwashed by the big propoganda machine named *Barcelindia*.

The Champions League has been around for decades, and it feels like every era has had a player who defined the competition.

Cristiano Ronaldo has the numbers and the clutch moments, all-time top scorer, countless knockout goals, and finals performances with multiple clubs.  
Lionel Messi brought consistency and magic, especially during Barcelona’s dominant years, with iconic goals and performances against top teams.  
Then you have legends like Zidane, who rose in big moments, or Maldini, who dominated the competition defensively for years. Even players like Raúl, Xavi, Iniesta, and Benzema have strong cases depending on how you judge greatness.

Is it about goals? Big-game performances? Trophies? Longevity? Or pure influence on the game?

Curious to hear how people define “best ever” in the Champions League and who tops your list."

Reactions from Bayern fans fall into two camps: some feel betrayed, thinking Bayern is just a stepping stone for him and that he should keep these dreams private. Others say he’s 17, it’s normal to have big dreams, and it’s not a slight against the club.

So as fans of other clubs, what do you think? Should young players be allowed to voice these dreams, or is timing and loyalty everything?

1q5n4ho,I want to apologize to Lamine Yamal,iwannasleepp,0,26,2026-01-06 21:23:18,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1q5n4ho/i_want_to_apologize_to_lamine_yamal/,"I thought he was overrated but the truth is deeper than that

After watching some La Liga matches where Lamine played, I have come to a conclusion that the problem is La Liga defenders are terribly terrible. 

So terrible to the point a bang average winger like Yamal can appear to be world class.

It's spectacular how much space they give attackers there compare to EPL. It's like they are begging for the opponents to score.

So it's not Yamal fault to be overrated, it's that La Liga doesn't know how to defend so the result were a cucu's victim can even get silver D'Or.

I maintain if Yamal played in Premier League he would not even lace Mbeumo shoes.

Thank you for the attention to that matter."

They would still do so even with Nicolas Jackson up-front as their starting striker. 



It was a foregone conclusion before Harry Kane would score tons of goals for Bayern Munich, which is the exception for any great striker in that set-up. 



The likes of Mbappe, Haaland, a 37-year-old Lewandowski, Julian Alvarez, Olle Watkins, Lautaro Martinez, Victor Osimhen, Alexander Isak and many other great strikers could probably achieve 20+ Bundesliga goals for Bayern.



Bayenr Munich is easily the biggest club in Germany, while having loads of phenomenal players. To call them a powerhouse would be an understatement. Before Kane's arrival, Bayern won 11 Bundesliga trophies in a row and 2 Champions League during that time period.



As the title says; Is Champions League trophy a bare minimum to view Harry Kane as a success for Bayern?

Maldini for the longevity (5 titles, 8 finals)? Maybe Raúl?

But I don’t understand how Chelsea fans can even feel identified with their club, the way their managers come and go, and also in most recent years with how many players they’ve had in their squad, coupled with how many decisive players have left the club.

- Di Matteo won the UCL in 2012 and he was sacked 6 months later
- Their all-time top scorer Lampard literally went to City and even scored against them in the Premier League
- Chelsea won the UCL in 2021, but Tuchel was sacked a year later, and to make things worse, no player from the UCL winning squad is left besides Reece James
- Havertz who scored the UCL winning goal and was only aged 22 at the time went to city rivals Arsenal. Mount was also aged 22 when they won the UCL, and despite being arguably their best player in the UCL KO stages ended up at Man. United. Jorginho also went to Arsenal and Kovacic went to City…
- Maresca won the Conference League and the Club World Cup this year, and was sacked today not even 6 months later

This is without even mentioning their two questionable ownerships this century, or the fact they currently have about 50 players in their squad between first team players and loanees.

How do Chelsea fans feel identified with their club when there is no stability and no sense of belonging? I’m not saying Chelsea is the only team where these things happen, but it’s definitely the only major European club where these things happen so frequently and without any regard to what managers/players have won for the team."

I hated the idea of a 36-team table, the weird Swiss model, and the fact that we don't play everyone.

But looking at it right now I truly don't know man. In the old group stage, by Matchday 5 or 6, half the groups were dead. You knew who was going through, and the last games were basically glorified friendlies for rotation squads.

Now? It feels like every single goal difference matters. We have massive teams sitting in 15th-20th place sweating over a playoff spot. One bad result drops you 8 places. The middle class of the table actually have a reason to fight for every point to get that top 8 bye.

Is it perfect? No. The table is impossible to read on a phone screen. But am I more engaged in random games between 12th and 23rd place than I was in previous years? Yeah.

Do you still miss the 4-team groups?"

I remember it well because I'm quite old. In 2017, Mbappé was criticized for his unnatural technique, mediocre dribbling, and uncoordinated movement. In his early years, at least until 2021, Mbappé wasn't good at playing on the left because his close control was terrible. Mbappé improved a lot technically at PSG, especially thanks to Neymar Jr. Mbappé's technique in the early years was absolutely disgusting. He didn't have Dembele's natural talent. Then he improved. But at first, he was just a very fast player with a great instinct for goal."

1. Longevity. He excelled at this one.
2. Players who were ahead of its time. 
3. Trophies. He also excelled at this one.
4. Goals. He ALSO excelled at this one.
5. IMO The most important thing, why we watch football, the way a player performs in the pitch. I dont think he performed nowhere near bad, but I think he lacks some very important qualities a player needs to perform well. For example, dribbling and passing. Is that it? Yeah, thats it. 

Dont get me wrong, he has good dribbling and passing, but we are comparing Ronaldo to players that made football look like art, and thats what I value the most about a player. 

just to name some players better than cr7 imo:

* messi
* maradona
* pele
* di stefano
* cruyff
* beckenbauer
* zidane
* ronaldinho
* r9
* xavi
* iniesta
* busquets
* kroos
* modric
* henry
* mbappe (yes, current mbappe is miles better than cr7, convince me otherwise)
* pirlo
* salah
* kaka
* kdb
* hazard
* platini

This might be an extremely hot take, but its my opinion, and i think people just say that he is one of the best players ever because the media needed a player to compete with messi, and thus they portraited ronaldo as the god of football.

Griezmann was in the ballon dor podium twice and arguably could’ve won both, the only weakness in his entire career was the Barca stint where realistically he wasn’t bad especially considering he was played out of position.
Godin was just a wall of a center back, and he knew how to pass the ball as well, with him the defence of Atletico was impenetrable, he was tall, smart and able to play on the ball, he had the goals like Ramos used to (barring pens) but for some reason he never come up on the talks of amazing CB’s.

1pshdp8,How did Ronaldo suddenly become such a great goalscorer?,[deleted],257,287,2025-12-22 02:19:19,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1pshdp8/how_did_ronaldo_suddenly_become_such_a_great/,"If we look at Cristiano Ronaldos younger years, he wasnt really a goalscorer. For example, I remember back in the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo was already seen as an absolute elite talent and as a top player, but not because of his goalscoring - more because of his general football skills. In his first 3 years in Manchester (2003-2006), he scored 27 goals in 137 games. But with those 27 goals in 137 games, he was already be seen as a star player in the 2006 World Cup. Just not a goalscorer. And even in his last 3 years in Manchester (2007-2009), when he won Balon D‘Or, he „only“ scored 91 goals in 155 games. Good numbers, but not close to what he scored later in his career.

Why did Ronaldo explode so much in terms of goalscoring from about age 25 on? Was he used wrong before by coaches, did people and coaches simply not knew he could have these goalscoring abilities, or did he really not have these abilities and only developed them somehow later on in his career suddenly? If he only developed them later, how did he do that?"

Each game Yamal assists or scores against mid table team, literally hundreds of post hailing he as the best in the world, while in fact, he is not even the 3rd best players in his own team atm much less comparing to true generational players like Mbappe, Haaland, Kane,...

Who is doing the PR for him? I believe they are Real Madrid fans who keep the hype up so Barca keeping the delulu on this average winger who at best can do stuff Mbuemo does on Mbuemo's worst day, subsequently, shatter Barca's C1 Compaign every year forward.

Generously, Yamal is at best top 30-40 players in the world and that's fine, not every player need to be generational. But there is ceiling to the game which needed to win the Champions League. You don't see Adan Januzaj winning Champion League on his own, do you? Yamal's ceiling is Juan Cuarado, but atm Yamal still half of a player Juan was.

In my view, good seeding should reward teams by giving them easier opponents, not by allowing them to skip an entire round. Skipping matches feels like too large a sporting advantage. I tried to think of an alternative that removes byes.  
  
Here’s the idea: Two league phases, followed by knockouts  
  
First League Phase  
\- 36 teams participate  
\- Teams are divided into 4 pots based on UEFA club coefficients  
\- Each team plays 4 matches (2 home, 2 away), one team from each pot  
\- Top 24 teams advance to Second League Phase  
  
Second League Phase  
\- 24 teams remain  
\- Teams are re-seeded into 4 pots based on their First League Phase ranking  
\- Each team again plays 4 matches (2 home, 2 away), one team from each pot  
\- Top 16 teams advance to Knockout Phase  
  
Knockout Phase  
\- Standard round of 16 → quarter-finals → semi-finals → final  
\- No play-off round, no byes  
  
Pros  
  
1. Removes bye advantage  
All teams reaching the knockouts play the same number of matches. No team qualifies by skipping a round, which improves sporting fairness.  
  
2. No extra matchdays  
Two league phases (4 + 4 matchdays) = 8 matchdays total, exactly the same as the current league phase. In fact, this format reduces congestion because there is no play-off round.  
  
3. Scalability  
The format scales very easily. More teams can be added (e.g. 40 or 44 instead of 36). The same two-league-phase structure still works.  
  
Con  
Fewer total matches due to earlier elimination. If UEFA’s concern is revenue, adding more teams is a possible solution."

1prw42o,Vinicius Jr is past his prime and Madrid should sell him,Short_Mousse_6812,0,49,2025-12-21 08:05:47,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1prw42o/vinicius_jr_is_past_his_prime_and_madrid_should/,"Vinicius Jr is a legend of the club, and no one can discuss that. However, his recent performances and behaviors just show he is not good for the club. He is not the only player, there are a few who act like divas and show no passion for the club. Vini is one of the most obvious ones because he has been under form for so long now. It is also hard to make the team work with Mbappe, Vini and Rodrygo. Essentially, three left wingers. Many claim Rodrygo should leave instead, but I believe he is more talented and if given confidence he can be even better. Vini had an amazing prime and should be given a farewell, but he is not adding more to the club, rather filling it with a bad environment. Mbappe was never needed in the first place, but now that he is here someone needs to leave to make space for him and make him the star.

Edit: he is a legend, wether we like it or not. He was crucial on two UCL wins and has been in the club for a long time while consistently starting."
1prjgw6,Is it fair to call Haaland overrated because he can't create his own shot?,Alternative_Carob562,0,114,2025-12-20 22:16:34,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1prjgw6/is_it_fair_to_call_haaland_overrated_because_he/,"This has always been my criticism of Haaland- if you look at the goals he scored against West Ham today for example, they were just a couple touches after the pass. When you look at Ronaldo, Messi, Mbappe, Neymar, Henry, Salah, etc. they can all dribble from 30 meters down the pitch, or dribble for like 15 seconds past a few defenders and create their own shot. It might just be the system Man City plays and/or the fact Haaland can't dribble to save his life, but it's tough for me to put him in the same class as those other guys because his goals are just a couple touches off the pass. This is why we have to look more than just the raw numbers and watch the film. Haaland has benefited from being around superb passers. When Xavi/Iniesta left, or before Ronaldo had Modric, Messi Ronaldo could still score. With Haaland, if you put him on a team with subpar passers, he can't!"

1ppw5dr,What do you think went so horribly wrong for Bayern against Real Madrid in the 2014 semi-final?,LazarM2021,37,129,2025-12-18 22:08:30,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1ppw5dr/what_do_you_think_went_so_horribly_wrong_for/,"I've always thought that the overall score (5-0, 0-4 in Munich second-leg) was overall... a bit lopsided/not reflective of the situation on the ground, having watched both games.

1pqxixe,Mbappé is not a Champions League big-game player and the issue is technical.,Window_Professional,0,20,2025-12-20 02:55:37,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1pqxixe/mbappé_is_not_a_champions_league_biggame_player/,"In my opinion, Mbappé is not a true big-game player in the Champions League, and the reason is quite simple: he’s not technically clean enough.

His:
-first touch is often sloppy
-dribbling lacks precision
-passing is inconsistent

In UCL big games  which are high-intensity, extremely tactical, and leave very little margin for error you need to be fast and precise on the ball. That’s where Mbappé’s limitations become very obvious.
At PSG he was obviously the star, or one of the stars, but never among the very best technically. 

It’s not a coincidence that PSG looked more functional without him last season, playing with Dembélé instead.
Dembélé is clearly an inferior goalscorer, but he’s much cleaner technically and allows the team to circulate the ball more smoothly.

With the national team?
Apart from the fact that he consistently struggles against Spain (the national team that plays most like a club side today), it’s also important to say that UCL big matches are on a different level compared to the NT games in terms of intensity and tactical discipline.
Right now, Mbappé is technically worse than basically every PSG attacker. Even Barcola is cleaner on the ball.

And then there’s the off-ball issue:
with Mbappé, you’re defending with 10 men. He doesn’t press, he doesn’t track back, he doesn’t contribute defensively.

So you end up with:
a player who is harmful with the ball because of technical sloppiness
and harmful without the ball because he doesn’t defend

People are surprised that his club teams never win the Champions League, but he’s a big part of the problem.
The only way to win with Mbappé is to have:
-elite players in every position
-a system where everyone else does double the work for him,
exactly like Real Madrid had to do with Cristiano Ronaldo for most of his carrer there.

Both are great finishers, but far less great all-around footballers."

1pph4k2,"Which Barcelona version are the absolute peak among the peaks? 2009, 2011, 2015?",Conscious-Two1428,15,60,2025-12-18 08:54:57,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1pph4k2/which_barcelona_version_are_the_absolute_peak/,"Firstly, about achievements:

2009: Won the sextuple, most successful on paper. Lack of challenges though, 2009 Madrid were bad. Controversial UCL semis where they got outplayed by Chelsea and luckily escaped.

2011: Won everything bar the Copa del rey, but also being challenged by a much stronger Madrid side.

2015: Won everything bar the Spain supercopa. Their UCL campaign is massively convincing and without any luck or controversy.

So 2009 team were the most success in trophies, but not significantly more successful than 2011 &amp; 2015 (the difference is only ""secondary"" trophies). On the other hand 2011 &amp; 2015 are more convincing and tougher competition.

Secondly, qualitative assessment:

2009 team introduced a brand new football style which caught every one off guard and unable to deal against them.

2011 team were pretty much the same football with 2009, but as a more complete version. They played a more perfect possession and positional game compared with 2 years ago, and Messi became more into his peak than 2 years ago. Their opponents were also more prepared against them.

2015 team played a different football from both 2009 &amp; 11. More direct football and less possession intensity. Still very dominant but also more unpredictable. Has the best front three ever (MSN).

**Conclusion: 2015 ≥ 2011 &gt; 2009.**

2009 team laid the foundation, but their later versions are simply superior.

2011 team is the best ever at total domination of the game, their opponents simply couldn't play football at all.

2015 team let their opponents ""play football"" more, but on the other hand were more deadly and unpredictable with MSN individual brilliance.

For me, it's a toss-up between 2011 and 2015 teams, I think the quality UCL run and continental treble give 2015 a slight edge."

AC Milan have won the Champions League 7 times and have 19 Serie A titles. Juventus only have 2 Champions Leagues, but they have won 36 Serie A titles. Does this make milan the better club?

Real Madrid add an interesting angle. From 2014 to 2024, they won 6 Champions League titles but only 4 La Liga titles. During their three-peat, they won the league only once. They’ve also never won a treble in their entire history.

I think a much stronger indicator of true dominance is winning the league and the Champions League in the same season. That shows a team was the best over a full year, not just over a knockout run. League + UCL together feels far more meaningful than the Champions League alone.

1pjnxzc,RANT: Antony Rudiger might be the single most infuriatingly stupid player I've ever had to witness,iammayashah,583,290,2025-12-11 09:02:25,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1pjnxzc/rant_antony_rudiger_might_be_the_single_most/,"I need to scream into the void after that latest penalty on Haaland. What in the actual hell was that?

Antony Rudiger. A walking, talking, flexing monument to footballing stupidity. I am convinced this man has the lowest football IQ I have EVER seen in a professional at this level. It's not ""shithousery,"" it's not ""being a warrior""—it's just being a brain-dead liability wrapped in muscle.

The man consistently makes decisions so profoundly idiotic it's like he's actively trying to lose games. Grappling Haaland on a set-piece IN THE BOX, for the MILLIONTH TIME, when the entire universe knows that's ALL VAR LOOKS FOR. It's not even cleverly disguised; it's a desperate, panicky bear hug from a player who fundamentally does not understand the basic, current rules of the game. It's pathetic.

And the ABSOLUTE GALL of him to then BRAG about this ""style"" of play. To give interviews about being ""vile"" and a ""nightmare."" You're not a nightmare for strikers, you're a nightmare for your own manager and fans! You're a self-detonating penalty dispenser! You bragging about being a tactical moron is the most shameful part. You've confused being a chaotic, reckless liability with being a hard man. You're not. You're just stupid and pathetic.

He is a poison. A player who substitutes any semblance of positional intelligence or disciplined defending with pure, unadulterated, reckless physicality at the worst possible moments. He single-handedly turns solid defensive situations into penalty box chaos and gifts goals to the opposition. And he seems PROUD of it. Disgusting shit from him each match, but he often gets away with it.

Every time he does that stupid open-mouthed grin after committing a career-ending foul that wasn't called. The man is a disgrace to the concept of defensive intelligence. I would have an aneurysm if I had to watch him ""defend"" for my club week in, week out.

This man is a footballing crime against common sense."

I personally don’t agree with it, at least not completely. He is definitely not a team player. He is the kind of player that has to be the main man. A team should be arranged for him to thrive and do his best. He is not a player who can just fit in a team with no structure and have collective success. Yes, he is going to score goals and be great individually because he is a generational player. However, when it comes to a whole team doing great, it is hard for it to happen unless the whole team plays for him. I don’t think this argument is completely true, but it has some true to it. "

for me its

5. Sanchez (PFA EPL player of the month and saving Chelsea from many embarrassments this season

4. Donnarumma (Very good still, but conceding more)

3. Kobel (just watch him play to know he’s next level)

2. Raya (most CS in the EPL and the UCL, due in large part to Arsenal’s defense though)

1. Cortois (this guy is the best keeper in the world and imo it’s not close)."

I understand there are rules to punish players who feign an injury to draw a foul, and that fouls and plays can be reviewed by VAR later on.

In this game one of the Liverpool player's arm swung around and hit the Inter player in the upper chest area.  The Inter player then went down, writhing in pain, holding on to their face.  The Liverpool player did not come close to touching the face, so this was obviously playacting.  Why can't the Inter player get a yellow or red after a quick review?  Do they not have a process in place to review these things to punish players for feigning injuries and flopping like this?  If not, would you want it?  

Just asking because this annoys me to no end."

His speed could destroy Manchester City’s defense, which is already struggling at the back.

Also, the midfield trio Ceballos, Tchouaméni, and Bellingham is not harmonious when they start any match together, and that limits the full-backs from pushing forward. Therefore, Real Madrid will play on the counterattack, not through crosses.

So putting García as a pure striker, in my opinion, is a big mistake. Let’s see what will happen.

The more Liverpool drag and depend on him, the worse the club becomes. That's the first problem.

The second problem is that Liverpool still hasn't moved on from Jota. So Salah must have thought something like: ""Why not? Why not make it all about Salah, simultaneously make the club doesn't depend on him anymore and have focus on Salah being out of his mind instead of Jota's story.""

There it is. Salah love the club so much he willingly destroy his legacy so the club can move on from this harsh period and officially on the new era from now on.

And he will be thinking about Liverpool, secretly in love still in a new jersey next season, watching sunset in a greatful Universe.

I am not crying, you are crying.

Endrick was killing it in a much tougher league than La Liga. Playing against all butchers willing to drag any youngsters down but still shines like a superstar already is incredible.

Instead they try to stuff 3 LWs in front 3. What the hell? How do you even compete against any top team with that in serious matchup.

Real got lucky Barca was having injury crisis else they would have been humiliated right there.

Alonso should step the f up and bench Vini or Mbappe and let endrick in. It's either that or he will be sacked tmr.

For example Ronaldo was being used as a scapegoat for Ten hags underwhelming spell and most recently Kyle Walker at City.I think he should leave now because if he gets what he wants and they give him minutes and he doesn't deliver, he will be the epicenter of excuses as to why Liverpool are doing bad alongside Slot."

* 1995–97: Quarter-final and group-stage exits.
* May 1997: Retired suddenly at 30, just two years before United’s 1999 Treble.

What if he stayed and not retired so young from football? A 33-year-old Cantona would have maybe won the 1999 final with Manchester United.

1pdrmvo,Mbappé is the greatest football player since Messi/Ronaldo.,Sad-Age-2863,8,199,2025-12-04 10:20:11,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1pdrmvo/mbappé_is_the_greatest_football_player_since/,"I think the football world is still underappreciating the absolute football freak that Kylian Mbappé is. 

The stats he’s been putting up while scoring ridiculous screamers are absurd. I’m not downplaying other great players in today’s game btw. I just think Mbappé is the closest thing we’ve seen to the two idols of my youth. Not because he plays like Messi or CR7, but because it feels like he’s forged from the same metal. I’m not saying he’ll achieve as much or leave the same legacy, but he could.

It’s interesting to look at the trajectory of the three careers.

Messi “peaked” young, with his highest statistical seasons and most trophies (aside from international ones) coming relatively early in his career (last UCL in 2015 at age 27). Won the World Cup at 35.

CR7 started peaking statistically around 2011, and then three-peated the UCL between the ages of 31 and 33 from 2016 to 2018.

Mbappé won a World Cup extremely young and has yet to win the UCL. This season is his first with over 60 goals in a calendar year, at 26 years old, the same age CR7 first did it in 2011.

Will he achieve half of what Messi and Ronaldo did? Still too early, and already impossible in some areas. But Mbappé definitely has the time and the talent to build a top 10 player oat case for himself. 

There are way too many football “fans” who can’t appreciate the greatness in front of them. Mbappé isn’t the only victim of this, forwards like Haaland and Kane are also massively underappreciated and downplayed compared to retired players. Like as a side note, Haaland has broken the premiere league and exploded any statistical ceiling people believed there was, and still somehow he's not an all time great already. Absurd."

1. Participation Fee

This is a guaranteed amount paid simply for qualifying for a competition.

Champions League clubs earn the largest participation fee then Europa League clubs then Conference League clubs.

It ensures that even smaller clubs who only enter the group stage for the first time come away with meaningful money that helps them compete financially in their domestic league.

2. Performance Bonuses

Clubs earn additional money for

• Wins in the group stage

• Draws in the group stage

• Reaching knockout stages

• Progressing to quarter finals semi finals and finals

Every European competition has its own prize scale but the pattern stays the same. The further you go the more you earn and the growth is dramatic in the Champions League where each round multiplies the prize money.

3. Coefficient Payout

This is where historic clubs gain a huge advantage.

UEFA ranks clubs based on their results in European competitions over the last ten years. These rankings are turned into shares and each share has a fixed value. Clubs are then paid based on how many shares they hold.

A team with long term European history earns significantly more than a newcomer even if both finish in the same position in the tournament. It rewards consistency but it also widens the financial gap between established and emerging clubs.

4. Market Pool Distribution

The market pool is based on the value of television rights in each country.

It means clubs from countries with large broadcasting markets earn more money even if they do not go far in the competition. The strongest market pools are usually England Italy Germany Spain and France.

A club from a smaller market such as Belgium Scotland or Switzerland might outperform a club from England but still earn less money because the broadcasting value in their home country is lower.

Pep said everyone who tried had failed. Messi scored. The “reward” was Messi’s signed 2012 shirt.

A moment tied to Pep’s last Barça game. A nice little piece of Champions League nostalgia for the community.

* Overrated/underrated opinions
* Bold predictions

The intention was good: to keep conversation flowing, let fans enjoy themselves, and avoid the sub feeling silent between fixtures.

However, it’s reached a point where off-topic posts toke over the subreddit.
Many users have shared that the front page has become difficult to navigate, and genuinely Champions League–related content is getting lost in the noise.

To restore the focus of r/championsleague, we’ll be removing non-CL content going forward, and returning the subreddit to its original purpose:
a place dedicated to Champions League matches, news, analysis, storylines, and discussion.

This doesn’t mean there’s no room for general football talk — far from it.

If you want a place for broader discussion, transfers, domestic leagues, culture, memes, or anything outside the UCL, we recommend using r/FootyUnfiltered, a community created specifically for open, unfiltered football conversation without strict topical limits.

This should help keep /r/championsleague focused, clean, and enjoyable for those here for the tournament, while giving everyone a space where all football topics are welcome.

Thanks for understanding, and thanks for keeping this community active and passionate."

You think with your non existent depth of a team can win it? Streight up delusional. Here is the only way you can do it:

Sell Yamal right now before his price drops because he will reveal himself bang average later.

Once you have that sweet 200 300mil. Don't spend it all to some hot names like you did in the past. Make sure you sack deco to prevent it. Wait for 2 or 3 years, saving for another several hundred mil, wait for another promising manager emerges, sack the fraud flick and hire him. Buy the new managers everything he wants but make sure you have at least 150m left to buy the last piece.

Bid Antony for 150mil and let him do magic.

Only the true Goat can bring the Champion League to Camp Nou, not the Fifa boy who promised empty words.

There it is. Only 4 or 5 year you will have your long waited Cup.

You don't do this? Well, better give up on UCL already from now on til enternity.

Well they have lost 1-2 to PSG who fielded their B team this year, and now just lost 0-3 to Chelsea. 

And it's not like Barca never had big defeats in the UCL history (2-8, 0-7), or even specifically in the final (93/94) so there's nothing guarantee that they wouldn't be massacred by PSG in the ""final"" last season.

Even if we need to think about that ""match"", I can't see any chance for Barca. Barca are never good against strong pressing team like PSG last season. PSG full back would easily pocket Yamal and Raphinha, and their front three would break apart Barca high-line defense."

1p774l8,Are La Liga teams declining in the Champions League?,[deleted],19,109,2025-11-26 18:00:27,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1p774l8/are_la_liga_teams_declining_in_the_champions/,"I’ve been wondering if we’re seeing a genuine decline from La Liga sides in the Champions League compared to recent seasons.

This year alone, Arsenal have comfortably beaten Spanish opposition including Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, and Athletic Club. Chelsea also just handled Barcelona fairly easily, and Barça barely scraped a draw against Club Brugge earlier in the campaign. Last season they went out to an Inter side that later got demolished by PSG in the final.

Even Liverpool’s form last year raises questions. They lost six of seven matches during that stretch, but the one game they actually won convincingly was against Real Madrid.

Are we seeing a broader trend of La Liga teams slipping in European competition, or is this just a short-term blip with some bad stylistic matchups?"

Barca is the new Arsenal in their banter era. All PR, no titles.

You lost because you suck, that's all. Accept it and build your clubs 3 4 more years before having the depth. It's better this way.

For all the progress, patterns, and promise, this season must end with silverware.

He would still get fouled a lot after 2013 as well(just like Neymar) but never suffered a major injury.

1p6emp7,I’ve built my own football match prediction model + website (currently in beta) – sharing details,ihangmyself,3,1,2025-11-25 20:00:41,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1p6emp7/ive_built_my_own_football_match_prediction_model/,"Hi everyone,  
over the last months I’ve been building my own football prediction engine as a side project, and I wanted to share what I’ve done so far — mainly from a technical/data perspective, not trying to promote anything.

The project consists of two parts:  
**1) the ML model**

* mainly logistic regression + additional decision rules
* momentum and form weighting
* odds-as-features
* backtesting framework (rolling window)
* model calibration
* live-data layer planned for next iterations
* data source: Football-Data API + my own preprocessing pipeline

**2) the website (beta)**

* simple UI that displays win/draw/lose probabilities
* daily updated predictions
* still very early, so bugs are expected
* using a lightweight backend + caching to speed up requests

Right now I’m testing how stable the predictions are across leagues and how backtested accuracy compares to live performance. I’m also trying to avoid overfitting and looking at ways to improve calibration under different odds ranges.

If anyone is working on similar projects or has experience with sports ML models, I’d be happy to hear about your approaches, especially regarding feature engineering, probability calibration, or dataset cleaning.

Again — not promoting anything, just sharing that the model + website are in beta and still evolving.

Here is the 2 tips from my Model for today champions league

Keep in mind that my engine and AI is still learning and working so value bets and everything that have above 65% of probablity should be considered to bet

For now i only recommend choosing top picks only from value bets tab (second and third screen)

While the scoreline of 3-0 makes it seem like Barcelona totally crushed them, in reality the match was extremely even and it was just a case of Barcelona being (mostly) clinical and Liverpool failing to put away their chances. I asked Grok, and it confirmed that in the game Liverpool had more expected goals, more big chances, and more possession than Barcelona.

1p4t2ee,Best Juventus XI of the UCL Era,Flimsy-Elevator-5693,6,26,2025-11-23 22:50:41,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1p4t2ee/best_juventus_xi_of_the_ucl_era/,"XI based on overall performances for Juve post 1992, rather than just the UCL. 

Going with a 4-2-3-1 formation, was thinking of a 3 at the back with wing backs but felt that the 4-2-3-1 was a better overall fit.

GK: Buffon. The greatest goalkeeper of the modern era in my opinion based on his longevity and sheer consistency. Honourable mentions to Peruzzi and Szczesny.

RB: Thuram. An absolute rock in defence with incredible positioning and athleticism, and arguably the best defensive RB of this period. Honourable mentions to Pessoto and Lichtsteiner, and Danilo (played plenty of games at CB but in a 4 atb I’m considering him for RB).

LB: Zambrotta. Equally capable of playing on either flank, I originally had planned to have him as one of the WBs in a 3-4-3 but it felt like I was shoehorning Nedved into a LWB role. He’s become underrated nowadays, but he absolutely deserves to be mentioned when discussing the greatest fullbacks of the modern era. Honourable mention to Alex Sandro.

CBs: Ferrara and Cannavaro. Regretfully had to leave out Chiellini, but these 2 have to be in the team. Both were complete CBs (height not withstanding), combining reading of the game with ball-playing ability. Honourable mentions to Chiellini, Barzagli, Bonucci, Montero, and Kohler.

CMs: Pirlo and Deschamps. Pirlo is the best Italian midfielder of his generation, and Deschamps’ work rate and positional sense was key to Juve’s success while he was there. Juve’s version of Pirlo would probably need another CM partnering Deschamps to protect him, but the backline is extremely solid and Deschamps is a great foil for him. Honourable mentions to Davids, Vidal, Pogba, Marchisio, and Pjanic. 

AM: Zidane. Not always the most consistent for Juve, but his 97/98 season was spectacular and it was impossible to leave out someone that talented. Honourable mention to Dybala.

RW: Baggio. Playing him out of position here, but he had to be in the squad. Italy’s most talented player arguably since the likes of Mazzola and Meazza. Honourable mention to Cuadrado. 

LW: Nedved. Zidane’s replacement, and one of the best wingers in Serie A history. Him missing the 2003 UCL final will always be one of the great ‘what ifs’ in football. Honourable mentions to Douglas Costa and Chiesa.

ST: Del Piero. The most iconic Juve player of the modern era, most famous for having a trademark goal i.e. the Del Piero zone. At his best, he was technically brilliant and great from set pieces with serious pace. He suffered from injury in the late 90s and never recaptured his original form, but was still world class. Honourable mentions to Cristiano, Trezeguet, Vialli, Higuain, and Inzaghi. 

Alternative formation:

GK: Buffon

CBs: Ferrara, Cannavaro, Thuram

WBs: Zambrotta, Nedved

CMs: Pirlo, Deschamps

AM: Zidane

STs: Baggio, Del Piero

LB: Zanetti. Inter’s greatest player during this period, and versatile enough to play on either flank or in midfield. Honourable mentions to Dimarco and Chivu.

CBs: Lucio and Walter Samuel. The list is understandably dominated by the 2010 side, but these 2 had one of the best defensive partnerships in the world in their short time playing together. Honourable mentions to Bastoni, Materazzi, Skriniar, and De Vrij.

DM: Cambiasso. Complete midfielder who combined his excellent passing range with defensive intelligence and reading of the game, and one of the most underrated players of this period. Honourable mention to Brozovic.

CMs: Barella and Stankovic. Barella has been a key player in Inter’s recent renaissance, while Stankovic was a similarly well-rounded player and had a great catalogue of goals. Honourable mentions to Motta, Di Biagio, and Calhanoglu.

AM: Sneijder. The most important player in Inter’s treble, providing the creativity and vision for their counters. Honourable mentions to Recoba, Figo, and Perisic (no wingers). 

ST: R9 and Zlatan. R9 has to be in despite his injury issues, having torn apart Serie A defences at their peak. Choosing who to partner him was tough, but Zlatan’s time at Inter, especially the last 2 seasons, were sublime and saw him win both the Serie A Footballer of the Year (twice) and Capocannoniere. Honourable mentions to Vieri, Adriano, Milito, Lautaro, Crespo, Icardi, Pandev, and Lukaku. "

Instead of brushing her off, he waited patiently, smiled, talked to her, and made sure she got the photo she wanted.

It’s a tiny moment, but these are the things that reveal who a player really is.

And honestly, when you combine that humility with his Champions League mentality, the consistency, the focus, the calmness, it makes sense why he dominated Europe for so long.

Stories like this remind you that the same guy scoring unreal UCL goals is also the guy treating complete strangers with kindness off the pitch.

Which players have your clubs been linked to that you would have most liked to see play for your team? 

As a United fan, there’s been a fair few players over the years such as Ronaldinho in 2003 and Lewandowski in 2012, but we signed the likes of Cristiano and Van Persie instead so it wasn’t too bad. I’d go with Gareth Bale who Fergie wanted to sign in 2007 while he was at Southampton, I think he could have replicated his development at Tottenham and would have gone a long way in replacing the star quality of Cristiano and Tevez who left 2 years later.

Going with a 4-4-1-1 formation.

GK: Schmeichel. One of the greatest goalkeepers of all time and instrumental to United’s success in the 90s, including the 95/96 season where United racked up wins by Schmeichel keeping clean sheets while Cantona produced moments of brilliance. The fact it took United so long to replace him speaks volumes. Honourable mentions to Van der Sar and De Gea.

RB: Gary Neville. He’s become underrated in recent years, not helped by how he often underplays his career, but he was the best RB in the league for a number of years. Honourable mentions to Paul Parker, Wes Brown, and John O’Shea.

LB: Denis Irwin. Extremely consistent, and described by Fergie as always being 8/10 on the pitch and pound for pound his best ever signing. Was a set piece specialist as well. Honourable mentions to Evra, Luke Shaw, and Phil Neville.

CBs: Ferdinand and Vidic. The best ever defensive partnership in the EPL in my opinion, with Ferdinand equally comfortable bringing the ball out into midfield or using his pace to catch up to opposition strikers, while Vidic was one of the toughest defenders in the league and superb in the air. Honourable mentions to Jaap Stam who missed out due to only spending 3 years at the club, as well as Gary Pallister and Steve Bruce. 

CMs: Keane and Scholes. Keane has become underrated in recent years and frequently dismissed as just a hardman, but he was a world class box to box midfielder who was also effective in possession and breaking through opposition defences and had a knack for goalscoring. Scholes wasn’t always the deep lying playmaker we envision today, but his technical quality and intelligence always made him stand out and he easily gets in the team. Honourable mentions to Michael Carrick and Paul Ince. 

RW: Cristiano. Had the best prime of any United player in this period. Honourable mentions to Beckham especially, as well as Nani, Park Ji-Sung, Kanchelskis, and Antonio Valencia.

LW: Ryan Giggs. His longevity speaks for itself, but at his best he was also a devastating winger, winning the PFA Young Player of the Year twice in a row. He later developed into a CM role later in his career, where he was extremely effective as a playmaker. Honourable mentions to Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young.

SS: Cantona. Kickstarted the United dynasty and a complete forward who combined goalscoring with sheer inventiveness and creativity. Honourable mentions to Bruno Fernandes and Teddy Sheringham.

ST: Wayne Rooney. The best English footballer of the Golden Generation, and one of the best forwards in Europe at his peak. Playing him slightly out of position as a pure 9, but it was impossible to leave either him or Cantona out. Honourable mentions to Van Nistelrooy, Van Persie, Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Mark Hughes, Solskjaer, and Berbatov. "

RB: Cafu. Joined Milan relatively late in his career but was still a top full back for a number of years. Honourable mention to Tassotti who similarly didn’t played long past 1992.

LB: Maldini. Could have put him at CB but he played more at LB during this period. Honourable mentions to Theo Hernandez and Kaladze. 

CBs: Nesta and Baresi. Nesta was as flawless a defender as they come, with supreme reading of the game while being good on the ball. Baresi was past his prime in this period but was still a top defender for 5 seasons. Honourable mentions to Thiago Silva and Costacurta.

DM: Desailly. May be a controversial pick, but I feel Desailly reached a higher peak compared to other contenders for the role. Honourable mentions to Gattuso and Ambrosini.

CMs: Pirlo and Seedorf. Pirlo was Milan’s technician in midfield under Ancelotti, while Seedorf was a complete footballer who could easily contribute on both ends. Honourable mention to Albertini.

AM: Kaka. His 06/07 season speaks for itself. Honourable mentions to Savicevic and Rui Costa. Have also left out wingers such as Leao and Donadoni to fit in more midfielders. 

STs: Shevchenko and Zlatan. Shevchenko is Milan’s best striker since Van Basten, dominating the scoring charts and winning the Ballon D’Or. Zlatan didn’t spend much of his prime at Milan, but was still one of the best strikers in the world during his stint there and would continue to perform when he went back in 2019.

His tactics are outdated, he can't manage the dressing room, his best now is to sneak a mickey mouse trophy (such as the conference league) but he can't build a sustainable team in the long run at all.

It has been 10 years since then and his career has been in a clear downward spiral  (Utd -&gt; Spurs -&gt; Roma -&gt; some clubs outside the top 5 leagues lmao).

Doing an XI for all the other countries combined, based on performances post 1992 not limited to the UCL.

Going with a 4-2-3-1 formation.

GK: Cech. One of the best goalkeepers in the world in the 2000s, and was critical to Chelsea’s success in the period. Honourable mentions to Courtois, Oblak, Chilavert, Southall, and Keylor Navas.

RB: Hakimi. Not too many great options here, an certainly none that have reached Hakimi’s level of performances. Honourable mentions to Ivanovic and Petrescu.

LB: Alaba. Has become underrated due to injuries and a decline and Madrid, but he was one of the world’s best left backs in the 2010s combining physicality with technique. Honourable mentions to Denis Irwin, Robertson, Alphonso Davies, and Chivu.

CBs: Vidic and Godin. Vidic was at his peak arguably the best defender in the EPL around 2010, while Godin was at his peak one of the best defenders in the world. Honourable mentions to Montero, Gamarra, Popescu, Marquez, Kompany, Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Koulibaly, and Benatia.

CMs: Keane and Modric. Keane has become underrated in recent times, often being derided as just a hard man, but he was a gifted footballer whose passes often helped to punch through defences, in addition to his will to win which often drove United. Modric is one of the greatest midfielders of all time and easily makes the list. Honourable mentions to Yaya Toure, Prosinecki, Essien, Vidal, Stankovic, Rakitic, Matic, Pjanic, Valverde, and Calhanoglu.

AM: Michael Laudrup. One of the most talented players ever, whose dribbling and vision placed him as the key creative force for Cruyff’s Dream Team. Honourable mentions to De Bruyne, Hagi, Savicevic, Boban, Litmanen, Nedved, James Rodriguez, Okocha, Hamsik, and Eriksen.

RW: Gareth Bale. His sheer quality as a footballer and his trophy cabinet speak for themselves. Honourable mentions to Salah, Brian Laudrup, Ljungberg, and Mahrez.

LW: Stoichkov. His arrival at Barca immediately resulted in a run of 4 titles, and he changed their dynamic with his aggressiveness and energy. He peaked in the early 90s but in his prime I don’t think there’s a better winger who can compete with him based on the parameters set. Honourable mentions to Giggs, Hazard, Mane, Sanchez, Son, and Kvara.

ST: Luis Suarez. The best striker of his generation, which is saying a lot given the talent we’ve seen come through, and the player we’ve seen come closest to putting up Messi and Ronaldo numbers while they were still in their prime. Honourable mentions to Weah, Lewandowski, Zlatan, Eto’o, Drogba, Shevchenko, Forlan, Cavani, Falcao, Aubameyang, Haaland, Dzeko, Mertens, Larsson, Berbatov, Mandzukic, Suker, Mijatovic, Boksic, Zamorano, Yorke, and Salas. 

Edit: Forgot about Schmeichel somehow. He’s in over Cech. "

LB: Nuno Mendes. He’s obviously still young, but no other Portuguese LB has reached the level he’s displayed. Honourable mention to Coentrao.

CBs: Ricardo Carvalho and Pepe, with honourable mentions to Ruben Dias and Fernando Couto.

DM: Paulo Sousa. Extremely underrated DM who won back to back UCLs with Juventus and Dortmund. Honourable mentions to Vitinha who’s played for a relatively short period, Maniche, Ruben Neves, and Palhinha. 

CMs: Rui Costa and Deco. Both were top playmakers of their era, with Costa being one of the best 10s in Serie A and Deco being the best player in Mourinho’s Porto side. Honourable mentions to Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva.

RW: Figo. One of the best wingers of the period. Honourable mentions to Nani and Quaresma.

LW: Cristiano, pretty self-explanatory. Honourable mentions to Leao and Simao.

ST: Pauleta. One of Portugal’s biggest weaknesses, but Pauleta was a solid striker who proved himself in Spain and France. Honourable mentions to Jota and Nuno Gomes."

Going with a 4-3-2-1 formation as Germany didnt have that many great wide players:

GK: Neuer. The archetypal modern day keeper who combined outstanding shot stopping with technical ability and sweeping runs outside the box stopping opposition attacks. Honourable mentions to Kahn, Ter Stegen, Kopke, Illgner, and Lehmann.

RB: Lahm. One of the greatest fullbacks of all time and a key player in Bayern’s and Germany’s success in the early 2010s. Honourable mentions to Reuter and Berthold.

LB: Brehme. Scored the decisive penalty in 1990 and was well-known for his technical ability, including from set pieces. Was tempted to shift Lahm over to the left and have someone like Kimmich at RB, but felt that Brehme was the better fit and he had played enough games in this era. Honourable mention to Howedes.

CBs: Sammer and Kohler. 2 key players in Dortmund’s UCL win, Sammer was the best German player of the mid-90s who took over the sweeper position when Matthaus was injured. Kohler was one of the best man-markers in the world, excelling for Juventus and Dortmund. Honourable mentions to Hummels, Boateng, Rudiger, Worns, and Buchwald.

CMs: Matthaus, Kroos, and Schweinsteiger. Matthaus is the best German player since the 70s, and one of the best box to box midfielders of all time before slowly moving back to a sweeper position in his later years. Kroos has been the metronome for a Madrid side that dominated the UCL, and has been a leading performer for the national team. Schweinsteiger was added to add more defensive discipline over someone like Ballack, but he was still a key player in Bayern’s success in the early 2010s. Honourable mentions to Ballack, Effenberg, Gundogan, Kimmich, Bein, and Thon.

AMs: Ozil and Muller. Ozil is one of the most gifted 10s of his era, with a unique playmaking style enabling Madrid’s counters under Mourinho, while Muller has been consistently excellent for Bayern and Germany and invented a position just to suit his skillset. Honourable mentions to Hassler, Reus, Moller, Scholl, and Musiala.

ST: Klinsmann. He was able to merge international success with club performances, and made up for a relative lack of physicality with game intelligence. Honourable mentions to Klose, Gomez, and Bierhoff."

Gone with a 3-4-3 formation with wingbacks to fit more defenders in.

GK: Buffon. Greatest goalie of this era. Honourable mentions to Toldo, Peruzzi, Donnarumma, Pagliuca, Marchegiani, and Sebastiano Rossi. 

CBs: Nesta, Cannavaro, and Chiellini. As a defender, Nesta was as flawless as they come with immense reading of the game, Cannavaro was superb for a number of years in Serie A and obviously had those performances in 2006, and Chiellini was a rock at the back for a Juventus side that won 9 titles in a row. Honourable mentions to Baresi who I felt didn’t play enough in this era, as well as Ferrara, Costacurta, Materazzi, Tassotti, Bonucci, Barzagli, and Bastoni.

RWB: Zambrotta, top wing back who was crucial in that “returner” role for Juventus and Italy under Lippi. Honourable mention to Panucci.

LWB: Maldini. Not quite his natural position and he’d have been a better fit as the LCB, but with Zambrotta bombing forward he could tuck in when necessary. The greatest Italian defender of the last 30 years. Honourable mention to Dimarco, but it’s not even close.

DMs: Pirlo and Gattuso. Pirlo is easily Italy’s best midfielder of this era, and Gattuso helps add some much needed bite in midfield. Honourable mentions to De Rossi, Verratti, Albertini, and Barella.

AMs: Baggio and Totti. Could be dangerous playing with 2 trequartistas, but these 2 couldn’t be dropped. Baggio is the most talented Italian player arguably since the 60s, and Totti’s longevity and sheer quality means he has to make the team. Honourable mentions to Del Piero, Zola, Mancini, Camoranesi, Donadoni, and Cassano.

ST: Vieri. Changed clubs almost every year, but the best Italian striker I’ve seen with fantastic aerial prowess and movement. Honourable mentions to Toni, Inzaghi, Di Natale, Vialli, Enrico Chiesa, and Immobile."

This list follows the same criteria used by the Basque Football Federation: a player is considered Basque if they are from any of the seven historical Basque territories across Spain and France, which include Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa, Álava, Navarre, Lapurdi, Zuberoa and Lower Navarre. Anyone from these regions is eligible regardless of their club or national team.

The selections weigh peak ability slightly more than longevity while still rewarding sustained excellence. The XI is designed to actually function as a team, and the honourable mentions highlight the strongest alternatives without repeating names across positions.

Let’s do a 4-3-3 formation.


GK: Unai Simón


Modern, consistent and already the most complete Basque goalkeeper of the era.
Honourable mentions: Kepa Arrizabalaga, Gorka Iraizoz, Julen Agirrezabala.



RB: César Azpilicueta


Champions League winner, elite defensive IQ and unmatched consistency.
Honourable mentions: Andoni Iraola, Álvaro Odriozola, Andoni Gorosabel.




LB: Bixente Lizarazu


Champions League winner and one of the best left backs of his era. His peak level comfortably puts him ahead of the other Basque options. Honourable mentions: Nacho Monreal, Yuri Berchiche, Asier del Horno, Mikel Balenziaga.



CBs: Aymeric Laporte and Iñigo Martínez


Laporte anchors the back line as the most complete Basque centre back of the era. Iñigo Martínez adds physicality, anticipation and leadership.
Honourable mentions: Dani Vivian, Aritz Elustondo, Yeray Álvarez, Mikel San José.




CMs: Xabi Alonso and Javi Martínez


Xabi Alonso is a generational midfielder and a clear pick. Javi Martínez complements him with ball-winning, athleticism and Champions League pedigree.
Honourable mentions: Martín Zubimendi, Mikel Merino, Asier Illarramendi, Beñat Etxebarria.


AM: Gaizka Mendieta


One of the standout Spanish midfielders of the early 2000s. Dynamic, technically gifted and decisive in big games, especially during Valencia’s Champions League finals run. Honourable mentions: Ander Herrera, Mikel Arteta, Oihan Sancet, Julen Guerrero.



RW: Nico Williams


Electric pace, one-on-one ability and the highest ceiling of any Basque wide player in decades.
Honourable mentions: Iñaki Williams, Markel Susaeta, Joseba Etxeberria, Ander Barrenetxea.



LW: Iker Muniaín


Creative heartbeat of Athletic for over a decade, with elite close control and playmaking.
Honourable mentions: Mikel Oyarzabal, Ibai Gómez.



ST: Fernando Llorente


Peak Llorente was dominant in Europe, elite aerially and decisive for Athletic, Juventus, and Tottenham.
Honourable mentions: Aritz Aduriz, Imanol Agirretxe, Joseba Llorente."

Going with a 4-3-3 formation.

GK: Casillas. One of the best goalies of the modern era. Had a drop off relatively early which means he lacks the longevity of the likes of Buffon or Neuer, but also started extremely early and was key to Spain’s success. Honourable mentions to De Gea, Valdes, Reina, Zubizarreta, and Canizares.

RB: Carvajal. Consistently excellent for Madrid and Spain. Honourable mentions to Azpilicueta, Salgado, and Ferrer.

LB: Alba. World class for a number of seasons with Barca, providing width down the left flank and linking up with the attack. Honourable mentions to Capdevila and Barjuan.

CBs: Ramos and Hierro. Ramos is the greatest center back of his generation and easily makes the team. It was a tough choice between Hierro and Puyol, but Hierro’s passing range and knack for goalscoring put him ahead. Honourable mentions to Puyol, Pique, Nadal, and Laporte.

DM: Busquets. The pivot essential to Barca’s success and revolutionised the DM position. Honourable mentions to Alonso, Rodri, Pep, and Marcos Senna.

CMs: Xavi and Iniesta. Who else. Honourable mentions to Fabregas, Thiago, Mendieta, Cazorla, Pedri, and Julien Guerrero.

RW: David Silva. City’s most consistent player for a decade, and was underrated in a lot of Spain’s success. Honourable mentions to Enrique and Mata.

LW: Villa. Played as a LW for Pep, and impossible to leave out given how central his goals were to Spain’s World Cup win. Honourable mentions to Isco and Pedro.

ST: Raul. Missed out on Spain’s success, but was key to Madrid’s triumphs in the late 90s and early 00s and was one of the leading players of the UCL prior to Messi and Ronaldo. Honourable mentions to Torres, Diego Costa, and Morientes."

One of the clearest picks in the team and the benchmark for Dutch goalkeepers in this era.
Honourable mentions: Cillessen, Stekelenburg, Krul.




RB: Michael Reiziger

A complete modern fullback who excelled defensively and technically. Dumfries has the athletic edge, but Reiziger is the better fit in a back four.
Honourable mentions: Dumfries, Janmaat, Van der Wiel.




LB: Giovanni van Bronckhorst

Technically sharp, composed and consistently reliable at the highest level.
Honourable mentions: Blind.




CBs: Jaap Stam and Virgil van Dijk

Stam was physically dominant and mentally unshakeable. Van Dijk became the best centre back in the world for a stretch and complements Stam perfectly.
Honourable mentions: Ronald Koeman, Frank de Boer, Stefan de Vrij, Nathan Aké.




CMs: Clarence Seedorf and Wesley Sneijder

Seedorf brings control, intelligence and unmatched pedigree. Sneijder adds creativity, playmaking and big game impact.
Honourable mentions: Edgar Davids, Frenkie de Jong, van Bommel, Nigel de Jong, Wijnaldum, Reijnders.




AM: Dennis Bergkamp

Elegant, intelligent and the ideal link between midfield and attack.
Honourable mentions: van der Vaart, Xavi Simons.




RW: Arjen Robben

Explosive, decisive and one of the most dangerous wingers of the modern era.
Honourable mentions: Kuyt, Memphis.




LW: Marc Overmars

Blistering pace and high end product during his peak years.
Honourable mentions: Gakpo, Memphis.




ST: Robin van Persie

The most genuinely debatable position. Van Nistelrooy was a Champions League machine, but Van Persie suits this front three better with his link play and movement.

GK: David Seamen. There really haven’t been great goalkeepers to choose from, with the alternatives being Joe Hart and Jordan Pickford.

RB: Gary Neville. I think they way he’s described his career and him playing for United has led to him being underrated by most fans these days, but he was a top two-way full back, being solid defensively while contributing going forward with a good cross on him. Honourable mentions to Kyle Walker, Trent, and Reece James.

LB: Ashley Cole. Could stake a claim as being one of the best in his position in his era. Honourable mentions to Stuart Pearce and Leighton Baines.

CBs: Rio Ferdinand and John Terry. They probably won’t get along very well anymore, but easily 2 of the best defenders England have ever produced. Ferdinand was one of the first true ball-playing defenders in the EPL, being able to bring the ball into midfield and had great pace, while Terry had underrated passing and was intelligent enough to cover for his lack of pace. Honourable mentions to Sol Campbell, Tony Adams, and John Stones.

CDM: Michael Carrick. Probably a controversial choice given I have to leave out bigger names, but he adds balance to the team and was underrated in his playing days. He’s gotten his flowers now, but his passing and tactical intelligence made him a top DM: Honourable mentions to Owen Hargreaves and Declan Rice.

CMs: Scholes and Gerrard. Scholes is one of the most technically gifted footballers England has produced, paired with a footballing IQ that allowed him to dictate the tempo of games. He also displayed a knack for scoring goals. Gerrard was a top box to box midfielder who could do anything on the pitch. Honourable mentions to David Beckham, Jude Bellingham and Paul Ince.

AM: Lampard. He nearly missed out for Beckham prior to changing the formation, but his sheer consistency and output meant he had to start. Honourable mentions to Gascoigne, Le Tissier, Raheem Sterling, Steve McManaman, Joe Cole, and Bukayo Saka.

STs: Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Rooney was the brightest talent of that Golden Generation and arguably the greatest English player of this period, while Kane has established himself as one of the best strikers in the world for over a decade.

Coach: Jupp Heyneckes (reached the UCL final twice in successive seasons, excellent in 17/18 too)

Asst. Coach: Hansi Flick (most destructive UCL team in the modern even if he couldn’t replicate the success beyond one season)

LB: David Alaba: Mainstay at Bayern for nearly a decade, played as CB in 2020

CDM: Lothar Matthaus: unlikely to not win the CL, legendary 

Thiago (CDM): most talented midfielder to play for Bayern in 21st century, unfortunately riddled by injuries, oozes class and quality

LM: Frank Ribery: Bayern’s first modern superstar, Ballon d’or podium in 2013

RM: Arjen Robben: absolute monster post Van Gaal, scored winner vs BVB

Oliver Kahn (GK): shorter prime than Neuer, but absolutely monstrous, specially in 2001
Bastian Schweinsteiger (CDM): remarkable class, quality and longevity 
Joshua Kimmich (CDM/RB): perfect Lahm replacement, absolutely crucial to Bayern in 2020s, future captain
Harry Kane (ST/CAM): only 3 seasons here and already a golden shoe to his name. Most complete striker to ever play for Bayern
Lucio (CB): Terrific player, warrior like

Please give your thoughts in the comments below

Edit 1: I’ld love to hear everyone’s choices on who the CBs should be. To me, neither Hummels nor Lucio nor Dante spent a long enough time at Bayern to warrant a place in the squad. Do give your opinions on this. Otherwise I had considered shifting Alaba to CB and Phonzie to LB (2020) or moving Matthaus to CB (sweeper) with Basti or Kimmich taking his place in the midfield.

Edit 2: My honourable mentions are limited because I stuck to 7 substitutes. Otherwise of course, the entire 99/01 squad deserves a mention. I have heavily leaned towards the post-2010 players because they are the players who I have watched more and no one can deny that this has been the most successful period in Bayern’s history since the 70s. 12 Meisterschale, 2 CL 🥇, 2 CL 🥈"

1p0fkm3,Best Brazilian XI of UCL Era,Flimsy-Elevator-5693,35,112,2025-11-18 20:55:37,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1p0fkm3/best_brazilian_xi_of_ucl_era/,"To be clear, I’m ranking based on overall careers, not just purely on UCL accomplishments.

Using a 4-2-3-1 formation.

GK: Alisson, there have been a few great goalies like Dida, Julio Cesar, and Ederson, but none of them have sustained a world class level of performance for as long as Alisson has.

RB: Cafu, with Dani Alves pretty much neck to neck and an honourable mention to Maicon.

LB: Marcelo, who I felt contributed more to overall play and was the chief creative force for Madrid compared to Roberto Carlos whose main role was to provide width. Honourable mentions to Filipe Luis and Alex Sandro.

CBs: Thiago Silva and Lucio, with an honourable mention to Marquinhos.

DMs: Casemiro and Fernandinho. Casemiro is one of the best DMs of his generation, while Fernandinho is heavily underrated and a key player for Pep’s early City side. Honourable mentions to Gilberto Silva, Emerson Ferreira, Ze Roberto, Dunga, Juninho, and Fabinho.

AM: Ronaldinho, one of the highest peaks of any footballer in this era. Honourable mentions to Rivaldo especially, Diego, Coutinho, Oscar, and Alex de Souza.

RW: Kaka, not his natural position but he has to be in the team. Honourable mentions to Robinho and Rodrygo.

LW: Neymar, his talent places him with some of Brazil’s best even if he hasn’t necessarily lived up to his full potential. Honourable mentions to Vinicius and Raphinha.

ST: R9. Arguably the greatest striker of all time, even with the injuries. Honourable mentions to Romario especially, as well as Adriano, Elber, Firmino, Luis Fabiano, and Mario Jardel.

1p1j5lo,Why Are Losers in the Champions League Now? UEFA Has Ruined It.,aboss101,0,16,2025-11-20 01:39:49,0.23,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1p1j5lo/why_are_losers_in_the_champions_league_now_uefa/,"The Champions League isn’t the Champions League anymore, mate — it’s finished. UEFA have turned what used to be a proper competition for actual champions into a money-spinning circus where 3rd and 4th-place merchants get rewarded like they’ve achieved something. Standards are in the mud. Back in the day, you had to win your league to earn your place in the European Cup. Now you can bottle the title race by February, scrape 4th on the final day, and still strut into the “Champions” League like you belong at the top table. 
It’s pure loser mentality football — exactly what Lee Gunner always says: modern football rewards vibes, brands, and balance sheets instead of winners. And the reason for the change is simple: money. UEFA completely bottled it and sold out the integrity of the game because they wanted the big clubs guaranteed in every season for TV numbers, sponsorship deals, and global marketing. They didn’t care about merit; they cared about keeping the cash printers running. That’s why they expanded the competition, added more spots, and let non-champions flood the tournament. 
Even the new format shows it — more teams, more games, more revenue, less sporting integrity. The whole thing has been watered down so much that it’s basically a franchise league now. You used to have to win something to get into Europe’s top competition. Today? You just have to exist, have a big fanbase, and finish “somewhere in the top four.” The Champions League died the moment UEFA chose money over merit, and now it’s just a participation trophy event dressed up as elite competition. Champions in name only."

They had won the CWC the previous year, and also had Neville, Southall, Reid, and Sharp. Tactically they were strong.

Would Liverpool 1987-88 claimed the cup? They had pedigree, John Barnes, and Peter Beardsley. That was considered a strong year for them.

What about the Arsenal teams that won the first division in 1989 and 1991?"

Whenever I hear people say bs like “Yamal is the best in the world” or “Yamal is better than Mbappe cause he always beats Mbappe team when they meet” it genuinely just shows how much recency bias there is in football today. Mbappe has not achieved all that he has in his career to be compared to Yamal. The only thing u can even compare both with is dribbling and even in that you can still say mbappe is a better dribbler "

Got a take that goes against the grain? Think a hyped player is overrated? Believe a “boring” team is secretly elite? Have a prediction no one else agrees with? This is your soapbox. 

This thread is all about sparking discussion. You don’t have to agree — in fact, you probably *won’t*. But that’s the fun.

**Share your:**

* Overrated/underrated opinions
* Bold predictions
* Unconventional tactical takes
* Disliked popular narratives

Just remember — **disagree without disrespect**. Debate is welcome, but personal attacks, trolling, and baiting aren’t.

So, let’s hear what football opinions you’ve been keeping quiet… until now."
